Traumatic life-threatening injuries often need immediate intravenous access for the delivery of fluids and medications. Although medics, nurses, and physicians are highly trained in obtaining intravenous access, when access is difficult or altogether impossible to achieve, alternative methods to accomplish fluid and medication administration are essential. Humeral head Intraosseous (IO) infusion is the process of delivering fluids directly into the marrow of the humerus to provide a non-collapsible entry point into the circulatory system. This technique is used in emergency situations to provide fluids and medication quickly when intravenous access is not available or not feasible. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) executed a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) initiative to analyze the scientific, technical, commercial merit, and feasibility of using a low-cost medical simulator for training medical personnel in Army Combat Training Schools the Humeral head IO procedure. As part of the initial phase, ARL conducted research and developed a capability to fill the gap in training this procedure. This paper will discuss how training requirements impacted the design and development of the Humeral head IO model and how subject matter expertise was utilized to identify performance metrics. Data from user evaluations exploring benefit to training, system usability (ease of use), anatomical accuracy, physiological accuracy, realism, and motivation to use will be presented.

Courses may bore learners; topics might seem shallow, or students content retention may fall below par. Increasing the interactivity of online courseware can boost engagement and learning; however, increased interactivity is sometimes just a euphemism for more technological bells and whistles. The challenge is further complicated when customers, such as trainers across the joint military enterprise, are either unaware of the full capacity of web-based learning tools or uncertain of how to maximize their utility. Thus, while employing state-of-the-art technology is admirable, what is most needed is a fresh way to use those technologies in more innovative and effective ways, to create tailored training experiences, and to facilitate organic learning (i.e., localized, tailorable). In other words, trainers need support leveraging the considerable e-learning capabilities that already exist, as well as making them personally meaningful and integrating them with other training experiences. In this paper, we examine how to close the gaps mentioned above. We first describe the power of developing organically centered training supported by e-learning technologies. Some of these technologies include tailored online course content and small group scenario trainers, both with embedded metrics to assess individual and team competencies respectively. We then describe how new and different uses of existing e-learning technologies can help joint trainers create rich learning environments designed to best support the needs of their units. In our own work, we have implemented instructional tactics such as situational judgment tests, card sorting using multiple- choice radio buttons, and story-based learning, and we are currently working on methods to capture e-learning content for team-centered part-task training. Finally, we close this paper by describing our next steps, including the andragogical principles we are exploring in our ongoing work to support training for the Chairmans six Desired Leadership Attributes in technologically supported training environments. Medical mannequins are used for a wide range of training purposes, including anesthesia, nursing care, and emergency care. Military medical training includes a significant component focusing on tactical combat casualty care (TC3). The TC3 curriculum targets combat medics and combat life savers, with a goal of training personnel in point of injury (POI) care. Many technologies augment TC3 training, including virtual simulations, part-task trainers, and medical mannequins. Unfortunately, most commercially available mannequins were developed to train nurses and doctors and have capabilities unused by the TC3 training community. As a result, the cost is higher than necessary. A recent research effort sought to develop a low-cost POI trainer with capabilities targeted specifically for the TC3 community. Within this paper, the research and design process of three prototype POI simulator is reported. Additionally, results of early usability testing conducted at the Fort Bragg Medical Simulation Training Center are detailed. The ability to read the human terrain is an invaluable skill set developed by Warfighters to identify irregular behavior in any environment. Traditional training methods (i.e., classroom-based instruction) have evolved to include Simulation- Based Training (SBT). SBT allows virtual representation of behavioral cues for enhancing combat training skills. Accurately modeling human behavior cues in a Virtual Environment (VE) is critical for success. Past research has highlighted difficulties with visually representing proxemics behavioral cues in a VE, however recent efforts have been made to offer insight into design requirements. Proxemics involves the spatial distancing between individuals given the climate of the situation and environment. This research seeks to identify design requirements and recommendations for representing proxemic cues within a VE. Specifically, this paper focuses on the development process of identifying, designing, and representing virtual models that exhibit proxemic cues. Finally, the paper discusses limitations and future directions for behavior cue training.This paper explores the literature regarding the development of higher order learning through student participation in technology enhanced environments, specifically, the use of mobile devices in the practice of critical thinking by leveraging inherent elements and affordances of temporality, space, and connectedness that mobile devices provide. The literature on mobile learning only recently began to explore critical thinking and remains focused on content delivery. However, the collaboration, just-in-time, and learning-on-the-go capabilities of mobile learning hold potential for deeper discourse within the context of higher order learning. This paper argues that carefully designed learning spaces, accessible by technology in hand, create beneficial opportunities for reflection and critical thinking that drive academia, business, and military organizations. However, poor definitions of critical thinking compromise its effective development and evaluation. Through an inquiry of higher order learning, critical thinking, mobile learning, and technology enhanced learning, the author defines and recognizes reflection as an essential component of critical thinking, identifies gaps in research associated with higher order mobile learning, and establishes the importance of critical thinking in mobile learning. As Army training budgets become more limited, a renewed focus has been placed on simulation-based training to maintain Soldier readiness. While simulation-based systems have long been leveraged by the Army as part of the continuum of Soldier training, their effectiveness is not often reliably assessed. A recent report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO, 2013) found that neither the Army nor the Marine Corps sufficiently assess the effectiveness of their simulation training systems. One barrier to conducting this assessment is the inability to leverage objective metrics of Soldier performance within simulation-based and live marksmanship training to optimize training outcomes. This paper discusses the foundational research being conducted to develop an architecture that will allow metrics for marksmanship training collected using the Experience API (xAPI) format, to support training effectiveness analysis, adaptive training systems, and training resource management. The novel Enders Game, while a work of fiction, presents a fascinating case study in how modeling and simulation can be applied for both individual and collective training. In addition, Enders Game is a great text, and practically required reading, for modeling and simulation professionals. Ender Wiggin, the fictional hero of Orson Scott Cards Enders Game, knew the value of simulation in the realm of training as well as anyone. Time and time again during his training regimen, he utilized simulations to test himself and his team up to, and at times beyond, their breaking points. Ultimately, the learning environment in their schoolhouse provided Ender and his team the tools for success. This paper will explore lessons learned from Enders use of simulation to train individually and as a team, and review Enders Game as a modeling and simulation case study. (Naturally, this paper contains spoilers about the novel). This study addresses the problem of pilots receiving ineffective training partly because there is no strategy for incorporating a proper mix of context elements into simulator design. The analysis includes a situated cognition theoretical framework to address the question of determining the influence of motion and visual fidelity on pilot performance in flight simulators. Secondary data on the performance of two groups of 12 qualified volunteer pilots in F-16 simulators using varied motion and visual fidelity were analyzed to research the questions. Research questions addressed the influence of motion fidelity in both high and medium visual fidelity simulators on a loop, offensive bomb delivery, and surface-to-air missile defense. Two different simulator visual systems were used to vary visual fidelity and a dynamic motion seat was used to vary motion fidelity. The study was conducted at the US Air Force Research Laboratory in Mesa, AZ. The study design includes two context-defining predictor variables, visual and motion fidelity, and five outcome variables: attitude control, load control, speed control, roll control, and missile avoidance in different contexts. In 13 of the 18 cases examined there was no observed significant effect of motion on pilot performance. In four cases pilots performed significantly (p < .024) worse with a motion seat. In only one case pilots perform significantly (p = .013) better when using the motion seat. Pilots in a high visual fidelity simulator performed significantly (p < .006) better in some aspects in all maneuvers. Reviewed in aggregate, the data suggest the sensory environment experienced during training does have an effect on pilot performance in simulators. The author suggests simulation-training designers should carefully consider the need for, and effectiveness of, motion systems. Recommendations for future research include a meta-analysis of simulation fidelity studies. Combat pilot training is a risky and costly requirement. Therefore, flight simulators are being used for decades to improve quality of the training and lower the costs. However, simulators could have a significant cost as the fidelity level increases. It is apparent that selection of right fidelity simulator would contribute to reducing the price and improving the training effectiveness. Therefore the relationship between the training requirements and the minimum level of fidelity that fulfills the training requirements needs to be investigated. Literature survey showed that little work was done in the area of simulator selection based on mission skills requirements. This study follows a two step methodology by first determining the minimum level of fidelity required for various mission skills than matching these requirements with various common simulator types to determine which simulators are able to fulfill fidelity requirements for each mission skill. In the first step an expert user group is utilized to determine main factors contributing to the fidelity in simulators then various common combat aircraft simulators are assessed against the factors determined above. Then mission skills are determined using a combination of mission types and singular skills common across various mission types. In the second step, twenty F-16 instructor pilots were surveyed to determine the minimum fidelity requirements for each mission skills. Then, survey results are combined with earlier findings to determine which simulator types are required as a minimum to fulfill training requirements for each mission skill. The results and trends are discussed in conclusion. In scope, this study focuses on basic fighter training environment and the results can provide basis for simulator selection and structuring the training curriculum.
