Modern job training often takes place away from the classroom. Students goals include  meeting training requirements, augmenting professional knowledge, and reaching career objectives. However, training opportunities are often limited by a students responsibilities and current tasking. Constraints also include the students location and schedule. In this work, we report on (1) a framework to formalize the representation, selection, and scheduling of training in a lifelong learning context. (2) An AI-scheduling algorithm to best choose training courses, venues, and schedules for the student. First, the framework includes training needs, including job requirements and career objectives. Second, the framework includes training opportunities, including information about training type, training location, competencies trained, and course schedules (times and dates). Third, the framework includes information about the trainee, including the trainees previous knowledge, skills, and experiences, and previous assessments. Once the framework is defined, sequential optimization algorithms can provide advice on training schedule. The algorithms consider hard constraints and soft constraints. Hard constraints include scheduling constraints and location constraints. Soft constraints include venue preferences, training environment preferences, and training type preferences. These constraints are balanced against student career objectives and goals. The selection is sequential, meaning that the algorithm looks ahead to the future, it is able to select a course because it is a prerequisite to another, later course. It is our hope that by carefully formalizing lifelong learning as an AI-scheduling problem, students will be able to achieve career goals and seize opportunities that balance against their existing responsibilities.
