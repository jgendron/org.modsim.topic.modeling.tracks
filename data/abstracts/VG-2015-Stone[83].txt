The use of video game elements in non-gaming systems, or gamification, has the potential to transform data analysis. Our study focused on creating a web-based videogame that models two physical test buildings, each of which contains hundreds of sensors. After the application renders the models, the player can walk through the environments and interact with the virtual representations of the sensors inside. Rather than querying a database with textual commands and spreadsheets of data, the user can (virtually) walk up to a sensor and view its data graphically. The recent progress in gaming hardware, game design, and data processing can be leveraged for data science. The net result is a more engaging and intuitive platform for data analysis that has the potential to provide additional insight for complex experiments.
