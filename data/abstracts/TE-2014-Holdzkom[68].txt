Representation of the natural environment and correlated environmental effects remains a challenge in combat and wargaming simulations. Achieving this physically realistic characterization of weather, ocean and dynamic terrain is important both for immersive or out- the-window views and for realistic impacts on system performance. For training, mission rehearsal, studies and analysis and acquisition communities served by modeling and simulation, this realism is critical to meaningful outcomes. In this study, we examine the OpenEaagles simulation framework, based on the Air Force Extensible Architecture for the Analysis and Generation of Linked Simulations (EAAGLES) system. OpenEaagles offers many aviation system components including a physically realistic flight dynamics model and sensor models. We document the natural environmental integration and environment effects offered in this framework, and present examples of simple simulations executed with and without realistic weather. We conclude with recommendations for improvements to OpenEaagles and avenues for future investigations.
