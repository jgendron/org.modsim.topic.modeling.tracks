During the past year the Defense Modeling & Simulation Coordination Office (DMSCO) has implemented major hardware, software and process upgrades to the discovery and reuse capabilities of the new Defense MANDS Catalog. Key enablers for the improved capabilities are the Enterprise Metacard Builder Resource (EMBR) Portal and the MANDS Community of Interest Discovery Metadata Specification (MSC-DMS), both DMSCO-developed, GOTS products that have evolved to complement and enhance the Defense MANDS Catalogs search and discovery features. This paper will demonstrate recent enhancements, describe a relevant case study and outline plans for future development.
