During the past year the Defense Modeling & Simulation Coordination Office (DMSCO) has implemented major hardware, software and process upgrades to the discovery and reuse capabilities of the new Defense M&S Catalog. Key enablers for the improved capabilities are the Enterprise Metacard Builder Resource (EMBR) Portal and the M&S Community of Interest Discovery Metadata Specification (MSC-DMS), both DMSCO-developed, GOTS products that have evolved to complement and enhance the Defense M&S Catalogâs search and discovery features.
This paper will demonstrate recent enhancements, describe a relevant case study and outline plans for future development.
