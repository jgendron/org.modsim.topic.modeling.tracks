Physically accurate soft tissue models find great use in medical modeling and simulation. When modeled as a continuum, soft tissue models typically rely on mesh-based techniques that are well studied. When the problem involves extreme deformations or discontinuities in the form of either material discontinuities or spatial discontinuities such as cuts and resections, the continuum assumption underlying the mesh-based methods disappears. In these cases, meshless (point-based) methods present several advantages over the former. In this paper, we present a framework for point-based simulation and cutting of soft-tissue to be used in the context of medical surgical simulation setting. The presented framework is implemented as part of the open-source medical simulation library SOFA, which focuses on real-time interactive simulations. The continuum equation of the deformable body is discretized using the meshless moving least square (MLS) based approximation scheme. The cutting operation is realized with a novel easy-to-use intrinsic meshless enrichment technique.
