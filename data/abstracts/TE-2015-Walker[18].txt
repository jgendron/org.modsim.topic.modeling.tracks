This study addresses the problem of pilots receiving ineffective training partly because there is no strategy for incorporating a proper mix of context elements into simulator design. The analysis includes a situated cognition theoretical framework to address the question of determining the influence of motion and visual fidelity on pilot performance in flight simulators. Secondary data on the performance of two groups of 12 qualified volunteer pilots in F-16 simulators using varied motion and visual fidelity were analyzed to research the questions. Research questions addressed the influence of motion fidelity in both high and medium visual fidelity simulators on a loop, offensive bomb delivery, and surface-to-air missile defense. Two different simulator visual systems were used to vary visual fidelity and a dynamic motion seat was used to vary motion fidelity. The study was conducted at the US Air Force Research Laboratory in Mesa, AZ. The study design includes two context-defining predictor variables, visual and motion fidelity, and five outcome variables: attitude control, load control, speed control, roll control, and missile avoidance in different contexts. In 13 of the 18 cases examined there was no observed significant effect of motion on pilot performance. In four cases pilots performed significantly (p < .024) worse with a motion seat. In only one case pilots perform significantly (p = .013) better when using the motion seat. Pilots in a high visual fidelity simulator performed significantly (p < .006) better in some aspects in all maneuvers. Reviewed in aggregate, the data suggest the sensory environment experienced during training does have an effect on pilot performance in simulators. The author suggests simulation-training designers should carefully consider the need for, and effectiveness of, motion systems. Recommendations for future research include a meta-analysis of simulation fidelity studies.
