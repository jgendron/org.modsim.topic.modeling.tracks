Simulation modeling is a well-established and essential tool for epidemiologic investigations, including population disease dynamics and the evaluation of mechanisms for disease control. Agricultural economic models allow users to go beyond disease impacts to explore the cost implications of animal disease. The United States Department of Agricultures Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health uses a variety of modeling tools to answer critical questions for planning and policy. In addition to describing some of these modeling tools, this presentation also covers some lessons learned while supporting the 2015 avian influenza outbreak.
