Combat pilot training is a risky and costly requirement. Therefore, flight simulators are being used for decades to improve quality of the training and lower the costs. However, simulators could have a significant cost as the fidelity level increases. It is apparent that selection of right fidelity simulator would contribute to reducing the price and improving the training effectiveness. Therefore the relationship between the training requirements and the minimum level of fidelity that fulfills the training requirements needs to be investigated. Literature survey showed that little work was done in the area of simulator selection based on mission skills requirements. This study follows a two step methodology by first determining the minimum level of fidelity required for various mission skills than matching these requirements with various common simulator types to determine which simulators are able to fulfill fidelity requirements for each mission skill. In the first step an expert user group is utilized to determine main factors contributing to the fidelity in simulators then various common combat aircraft simulators are assessed against the factors determined above. Then mission skills are determined using a combination of mission types and singular skills common across various mission types. In the second step, twenty F-16 instructor pilots were surveyed to determine the minimum fidelity requirements for each mission skills. Then, survey results are combined with earlier findings to determine which simulator types are required as a minimum to fulfill training requirements for each mission skill. The results and trends are discussed in conclusion. In scope, this study focuses on basic fighter training environment and the results can provide basis for simulator selection and structuring the training curriculum.
