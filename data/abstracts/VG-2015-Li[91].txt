 The popular Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for solving the network equilibrium problems has been well- documented in the literature. Other (more efficient) variations of the FW algorithm (such as Conjugate FW, Bi- Conjugate FW algorithms) have also been extensively studied by the research communities. In this paper, the basic FW algorithm is re-visited, with the ultimate goal of developing a useful, user-friendly, and attractive Java computer animation for effectively teaching this basic/important (transportation network equilibrium) algorithm. Since the shortest path (SP) algorithm (such as the well-known Dijkstra algorithm) is a basic building block within the FW algorithm, the readers are assumed to have a working knowledge about Dijkstra SP algorithm. The final product from this work will help both the students and their instructor not only to master this technical subject, but also to provide a valuable tool for obtaining the solutions for homework assignments, class examinations, self-assessment studies, and other coursework. Engineering educators who have adopted flipped class-room instruction can also utilize the developed JAVA animation software for students to self-learn these algorithms at their own time (and at their preferable locations), and use valuable class-meeting time for more challenging (real-life) problems discussions.
