At point of injury, military medical personnel are faced with traumatic life-threatening injuries that often need immediate vascular access for the delivery of fluids and medications. In a pre-hospital setting, lack of immediate vascular access during patient resuscitation and stabilization can be fatal. When traditional methods of vascular access (e.g., intravenous (IV)) are difficult or infeasible, alternative methods are vital to access the circulatory system to deliver fluids and medications. Humeral Head Intraosseous infusion (HHIO) is the process of delivering fluids directly into the bone marrow space of the humerus to provide a non-collapsible entry point into the circulatory system. This technique has proven to be extremely effective when used in emergency situations where intravenous access is not feasible. Intraosseous infusion for emergency purposes has a long history of use dating back to the 1920s. The use of the IO space reached a peak during World War II, when it was used by combat medics to assist soldiers exhibiting signs of hemorrhagic shock. IO re-emerged as a viable alternative during recent conflicts due to advances in technology and is part of the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines when IV access is not feasible. This paper will discuss the user-centric methodology and challenges encountered when developing a high fidelity model to support the training of medical personnel during the small business innovative research (SBIR) Phase II. The feedback received as a part of the usability study was utilized to guide the Phase II design.
