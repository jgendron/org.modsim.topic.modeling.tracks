Data Farming is a methodology that combines simulation modeling, rapid scenario generation, high performance computing, experimental design, analysis and visualization, and collaborative processes. Data farming is a quantified approach that examines questions in large possibility spaces and evaluates whole landscapes of outcomes to draw insights from outcome distributions and outliers. Wargaming is an activity not involving actual forces, but represents military operations in conflict situations of various types. Wargaming normally attempts to adjudicate sequential player decisions within a representation of simultaneity. Each player, who can represent a nation-state or other political-military entity, takes actions in turn based on the current situation and within the limits of the game as to their ability to react to the most recent moves made by players before them during a game turn. In this paper we describe our work combining the power of data farming with wargaming in order to demonstrate the synergies between the two in capturing the dynamic interaction among friendly, adversary, and other forces. We discuss our work with a Hybrid Warfare scenario involving coalition forces requiring extensive knowledge of the decision-makers and their long-term goals, their risk attitude, their rational and irrational constraints, diplomatic capabilities, and strategic agility. In particular, we consider the elements of conventional forces and irregular forces; police forces and influence on urban/rural areas; force mix of political, military, industrial, and cyber warfare initiatives; national threat influence from beyond borders, election interference and external propaganda effects; and impacts of cyber and national infrastructure interference.
