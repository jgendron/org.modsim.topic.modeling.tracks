Data Farming is a methodology that combines simulation modeling, rapid scenario generation, high performance computing, experimental design, analysis and visualization, and collaborative processes. Data farming is a quantified approach that examines questions in large possibility spaces and evaluates whole landscapes of outcomes todrawinsightsfromoutcomedistributionsandoutliers.Wargamingisanactivitynot involving actualforces,but represents military operations in conflict situations of various types. Wargaming normally attempts to adjudicate sequentialplayerdecisionswithinarepresentationofsimultaneity.Eachplayer,whocanrepresentanation-state or otherpolitical-militaryentity,takesactionsinturnbasedonthecurrentsituationandwithinthelimits ofthegameas to their ability to react to the most recent moves made by players before them during a game turn.
In this paper we describe our work combining the power of data farming with wargaming in order to demonstrate thesynergiesbetweenthetwoincapturingthedynamicinteractionamongfriendly,adversary,andotherforces.We d i s c u s s o u r w o r k w i t h a H y b r i d W a r f a r e s c e n a r i o i n v o l v i n g c o a l i t i o n f o r c e s r e q u i r i n g e xt e n s i v e k n o w l e d g e o f t h e decision-makers and their long-term goals, their risk attitude, their rational and irrational constraints, diplomatic capabilities,andstrategicagility.Inparticular,weconsidertheelementsofconventionalforces andirregularforces; police forces and influence on urban/rural areas; force mix of political, military, industrial, and cyber warfare initiatives;nationalthreatinfluencefrombeyondborders,electioninterferenceandexternalpropagandaeffects;and impacts of cyber and national infrastructure interference.
