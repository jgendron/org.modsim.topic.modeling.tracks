This paper presents the development of an Ultrasonography Simulator Training Tool. Ultrasonography is a user-dependent technology requiring Operator motor skills for appropriate probe manipulation and cognitive skills to capture images, acquire situational awareness, and interpret pathology. Three challenges arise in developing a cost-effective simulator training tool that provides physical (hardware) and cognitive (software-visualization) learning experiences: 1) ability to place pathology on a body-like shape (mannequin) without attaching sensors to the surface, 2) ability to track and register pathology and the probe using Commercial Off the Shelf gaming devices, and 3) engaging gaming development software for simulating echo patterns of ultrasound beams from animated 3D surface data in real-time and display a realistic 2D dynamic ultrasound image. With medical collaboration this project produces a prototype real-time, dynamic ultrasound simulator trainer specific for cardiac interrogation. It accommodates extendable dedicated teaching components with additional 3d anatomical data and teaching materials for instructor observation capability.
