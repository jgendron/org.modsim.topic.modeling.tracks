Instructional designers can have a profound impact on the bottom line of every corporate and industrial organization. Training Magazines 2016 Training Industry Report found that U.S.-based educational institutions and corporations with 100 or more employees spent $70.65 billion total training expenditures in 2016; flat from $7.6 billion in 2015. Training expenditures per learner in 2016 was $814, which is up from $702 in 2015 (Training Magazine, 2016). However, actual hours of training per employee decreased from 53.8 hours in 2015 to 43.8 hours in 2016 (Training Magazine, 2016). Implementing technology-based training programs is more expensive but decreases the amount of time needed to train the workforce. Instructional designers often rely on theoretical knowledge to account for allowances and limitations of technology in order to determine if the level of effort to implement is worth the risk of possibly developing ineffective training. It is a delicate balancing act that could potentially cost the organization a great deal of money if the instructional designer misinterprets the technology use case. As yet, research has failed to study both the competence and practice of instructional design in a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) environment (Tracey & Boling, 2014). This paper introduces a dissertation qualitative study that explores instructional design considerations when designing VR-based training. Using a modified Delphi research design, the results from this study will identify possible best practices that could be used by instructional designers when designing VR-based training in order to improve practice in the instructional design field.
