The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health addresses questions related to minimizing the consequences of animal disease outbreaks while protecting the nations livestock, food, and the environment. That includes modeling the economic impact of potential disease outbreaks using the Paarlberg model. The Paarlberg model is a quarterly economic model that allows analysts to simulate the potential economic impact of different types of disease spread across a number of different industries and commodities. Analysts are able to apply shocks reflecting how different industries and trade partners are affected by a specific disease spread scenario and estimate the market impacts. The model produces large data sets that need to be analyzed and summarized. To do so, we used a data visualization software called Tableau. Tableau allows us to handle, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data in an efficient manner. We create dashboards that allow analysts and decision-makers alike to understand trends and patterns from model runs.
