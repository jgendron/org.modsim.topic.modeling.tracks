Data Farming is a quantified approach that examines questions in large possibility spaces using modeling and simulation. It evaluates whole landscapes of outcomes to draw insights from outcome distributions and outliers. The Data Farming Support to NATO task group has codified the data farming methodology and a follow-on task group is now applying data farming to important NATO question areas. The development of data mining and data visualization techniques also continues to help us understand the huge amount of simulation data resulting from data farming. This paper outlines the documented data farming techniques, illustrates data farming in the context of quantitative analysis of cyber defense technologies and measures, and describes the links to predictive analyses made possible by advancing the connection of data farming to data mining and data visualization. The paper describes a prototype simulation using an agent-based model (NetLogo) that the NATO task group team has developed with feedback from subject-matter experts. The paper also describes the data farming the team has performed on key model parameters to begin to get insight into cyber security what-if questions.
