Anatomical structures can be displayed for educational or training purposes through several different visualization technologies. However, these technologies differ regarding their usability and display of spatial information. The present research compared three visualization technologies in the learning of gross human brain anatomy. Participants, aged 18-28 (N = 90, Mdn = 18, IQR = 1), were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a PowerPoint condition, where 2D brain images with monocular depth cues were presented on a computer screen, (2) a Physical Model condition, involving a plastic 3D brain model that could be disassembled into eight parts, and (3) a Virtual Reality condition, where 3D brain models were presented using HTC Vive technology. The visualization technologies were evaluated on how well they enabled identification and spatial learning of selected brain structures, on overall usability, and on the amount of study time participants used with the technology. Participants were given a computerized test assessing their knowledge of the brain structures before and after studying with the technology. Participants in the PowerPoint condition used significantly less study time and completed questions on brain structure identification and spatial relationships faster than participants in the Physical Model and Virtual Reality conditions. There were no significant differences in identification/spatial anatomy accuracy, confidence, or technology usability. These findings provide insight into the relative costs and benefits of different 3D visualization technologies for learning gross anatomy. Future research should investigate other measures of effectiveness and learner reactions regarding the use of 3D visualization technologies in anatomical training.
