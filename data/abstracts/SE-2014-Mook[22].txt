Typically, commercially available modeling and simulation products are tools that allow Modeling and Simulation (M&S) practitioners to construct, run, and analyze simulations. These products are useful only to professionals in the M&S field who know how to properly construct a model and generate the required analysis. This necessitates the use of commercial products in conjunction with a professional to sell modeling and simulation as a service. In certain situations, customers may not want to purchase a service, but a tool that they can use themselves. This paper presents an approach to M&S which results in a standalone tool. The tool in this example was developed specifically for use in a manufacturing setting, not by the M&S professional, but by the people in charge of planning and executing the work. By shaping the inputs and the analysis to align with the customer√ïs knowledge base, a non- M&S user can complete simulations with little or no assistance from the experts that developed the model.
