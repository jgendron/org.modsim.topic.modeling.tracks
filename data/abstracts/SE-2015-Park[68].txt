There is a lack of interoperability, limited reuse and loose integration between the Live, Virtual and/or Constructive assets across multiple Standard Simulation Architectures (SSAs). There has been much research to solve these problems but their solutions resulted in complex and inflexible integration, long time of user-usage and high cost for LVC simulation. The purpose of this research is to provide an agile roadmap for the Live Virtual Constructive-Integrating Training Architecture (LVC-ITA) that will address the above problems and introduce interoperable LVC simulation. In addition, this research illustrated a case study using an Adaptive distributed parallel Simulation environment for Interoperable and reusable Model (AddSIM) that is a component based integrated simulation engine. The agile roadmap of the LVC-ITA that reflected the lessons learned from the case study will contribute to guide Modeling and Simulation (MANDS) developing communities to an efficient path to increase interoperability, composability and integration of LVC assets.
