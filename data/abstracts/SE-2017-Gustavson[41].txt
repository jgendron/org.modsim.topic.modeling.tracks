Cybersecurity Engineering operates within the new domain of Cyberspace, and is focused on the security aspects of systems to ensure the design, architecture, and development are robust enough to deal with diverse disruptions once deployed. Disruptions might include a malicious attack, a security breach, infrastructure degradation due to natural disaster, an insider threat, or a physical act of terrorism. The opportunity exists to leverage Modeling and Simulation (MANDS) in a novel way to represent and assess security vulnerabilities, and engineer and test security enhancements without compromising operational integrity. Namely, it provides an efficient and expedient means to facilitate Cybersecurity Engineering. It is a game changer. This paper explores the benefit and approach to develop and use threat models and penetration (pen) test models upon representations of weapon systems (current or future). Virtual systems, simulations and stimulators representing these systems can be distributed via networks. Models and adjunct simulations reflecting cyber threats, malicious effects, and pen injections can be used in the context of this distributed environment to assess and validate system designs and architectures without compromising integrity. MANDS provides a means to evaluate potential threats before they're exposed and in the wild, and promotes security engineering early in the development process. It offers a means to bolster system integrity creating greater confidence of systems before they are deployed or updated. This paper discusses the important elements of security engineering that can be supported using MANDS, and offers four steps to begin to leverage MANDS in a new and novel way.
