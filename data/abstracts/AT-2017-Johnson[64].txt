Department of Defense (DoD) organizations are challenged to compile and align Modeling and Simulation (M&S) information from a combination of data sources across multiple stakeholders. Aggregating useful data and analytics throughout program lifecycles is difficult because current practice typically relies upon static, disconnected, stove- piped sources of information. Digital Engineering (DE) is an emerging concept articulated by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) designed to strengthen engineering discipline. It is an integrated, model-based approach to support the planning, design, operation, and sustainment of DoD programs. With support from the DoD Modeling & Simulation Coordination Office (DMSCO), the M&S Workbench was developed as an open source, modular software tool that enables the development of a DE ecosystemÑa digital environment for team collaboration based on authoritative sources of information. This integrated M&S approach, supported by a digital engineering ecosystem, has been proven effective. The M&S Workbench is currently utilized by Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) providing its M&S team visibility to hundreds of structured and unstructured data sources and Òground truthÓ collaboration throughout all phases of the systems engineering lifecycle. Key benefits of this approach are enhanced communication across the PEO IWS enterprise and increased confidence in delivering the best M&S outcomes within cost and schedule.
