The ability to read the human terrain is an invaluable skill set developed by Warfighters to identify irregular behavior in any environment. Traditional training methods (i.e., classroom-based instruction) have evolved to include Simulation- Based Training (SBT). SBT allows virtual representation of behavioral cues for enhancing combat training skills. Accurately modeling human behavior cues in a Virtual Environment (VE) is critical for success. Past research has highlighted difficulties with visually representing proxemics behavioral cues in a VE, however recent efforts have been made to offer insight into design requirements. Proxemics involves the spatial distancing between individuals given the climate of the situation and environment. This research seeks to identify design requirements and recommendations for representing proxemic cues within a VE. Specifically, this paper focuses on the development process of identifying, designing, and representing virtual models that exhibit proxemic cues. Finally, the paper discusses limitations and future directions for behavior cue training.
