This article presents an IoT (Internet of Things) prototype integrated to a virtual designed environment to allow monitoring and control of electrical substations. The prototype system was developed and tested using an ESP-8266 module, NodeMCU and sensor systems. The main components of the proposed system are: a network of Wi-Fi sensors, a MQTT broker service that acts as a broker connecting sensors as clouds, and a virtual environment developed for the control and monitoring of electrical substations. The use of a wireless network for data collection within a substation presents some advantages comparing with routed networks while the inclusion of a sensor network allows a provision of complementary resources such as monitoring and control of processes inherent in the substation.
