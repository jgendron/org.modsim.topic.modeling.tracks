For complex systems of interest to numerous stakeholders, spanning a broad range of disciplines and perspectives, the necessity and priority of visualized information is personal. Customization of large data sets typically includes elements of searchability, retrieveability, and configuration management; but the visualization of that data is often limited to a designated platform, such as a tablet or mobile phone. Georgia Tech Research Institute and Design Mill, Inc. are partnering to make Platform-Independent Visualization (PIV) a reality for the U.S. Marine Corps. This approach of stakeholder-driven design, rather than platform-driven design, pushes visualization into a new category of customizable information. Authors Lenuik and Murley walk through the development and deployment of a scalable PIV framework to support visualization across any device (desktop, web, mobile, wearable-computing), in both connected and disconnected states.
