In 2001 Landstown High School was identified by the Virginia Beach City Public Schools Board of Education as the school divisions Technology Academy with a charge to offer the students of Virginia Beach state of the art educational opportunities within the fields of Entrepreneurship, Information Technology and Engineering. The Landstown High School Governors STEM Academy in Virginia Beach, Virginia was created by the Virginia State Board of Education in 2012. The Virginia State Board of Education originally approved the STEM Academy with one pathway, Engineering, that would operate separate from the local technology based academy programs, and upon completion of the Engineering pathway, award each student completing the highly rigorous program a highly coveted Governors Seal on their diploma. It quickly became evident that additional Governors STEM Engineering based pathways would be required to meet the needs of the industry that the Virginia Educational system, and Virginia Beach City Public Schools, serves. Through the 2012-13 school year data was collected to determine the pathway that would be submitted to expand the offerings at Landstown Governors STEM Academy. This paper/presentation will report on the progress of the Landstown Governors STEM Academys Modeling and Simulation Pathway. This paper/presentation will present a framework for other school divisions wishing to establish a high school based Modeling and Simulation Pathway for their students in grades 9-12. The establishment of a framework that can be replicated is critical to the expansion of Modeling and Simulation as a course elective at the high school level.
