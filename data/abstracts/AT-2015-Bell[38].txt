Analysts across the Intelligence Community (IC), including Department of Defense (DOD) intelligence components, face rapid growth in the volume and levels of fidelity of data to be transformed into intelligence. At the same time, the IC is experiencing a reduction of skilled senior analysts due to attrition and budget compression. At a time when all-source, multi-int, and open-source analysis are becoming critical to combating state-sponsored terrorism, transnational threats, and hostile proto-states, any knowledge, skills or experience gaps must be seriously examined and remedied. These challenges are familiar but new influences are exacerbating these gaps. Open source information has grown dramatically, driven by traditional news outlets offering digital editions and nontraditional conduits such as blogs and social media. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) has assumed greater importance as conflict zones are often in regions that lack traditional infrastructure and communications networks. In summary, analysts are facing unprecedented volumes of information and an acute requirement for advanced analytical techniques. A systemic improvement that could address these challenges is a new approach to training that embeds the effective use of proven, replicable methods for intelligence analysis in authentic scenarios. In this paper we describe a simulation enabled by online, scenario-based training incorporating a repeatable and proven analytic workflow. Tradecraft & Analysis Learning using Intelligence Scenarios with Methods-Anchoring (TALISMAN) applies scenario-based, technology-enriched training to create web-accessible interactive training scenarios. TALISMAN will equip analysts with the skills and knowledge to identify adversary locations, clandestine facilities, illicit activities, and other phenomenology using a proven composite signatures methodology.
