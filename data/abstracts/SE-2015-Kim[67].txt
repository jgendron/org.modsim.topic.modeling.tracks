Interoperating Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) simulations has been major goal and challenge in Modeling and Simulation (MANDS) community. Achieving interoperability of LVC simulations is a technically and managerially complex task, and this makes simulation interoperability experts consider multiple factors originated from multiple domains. Successful interoperation of LVC Simulation is determined by the well-organized Systems Engineering (SE) process because SE process defines a generalized and overall process for building and executing distributed simulation environments. Thus interoperability readiness level of simulation systems and relevant organization can be measured as a part of the simulation interoperability design phase. This research aims to design a framework to measure the potential interoperability level of a simulation system and a relevant organization in technical, conceptual and organizational prospects. Specifically, an LVC simulation interoperability measurement framework that contains an LVC simulation interoperability maturity model and an interoperability measurement process is proposed. To accomplish the goal, a set of factors that determine the potential interoperability level of LVC simulations are identified through a literature review and a survey involving a number of relevant domain experts. The factors are used to build the key elements of the framework. A case study is demonstrated to prove the validity and effectiveness of the developed framework.
