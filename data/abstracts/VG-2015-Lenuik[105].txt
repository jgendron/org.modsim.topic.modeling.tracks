Decision making often requires an understanding of where we are, where we want to go, and the options for traversing this distance. Where augmented reality enhances a view of where we are and virtual reality creates a view of where we want to go, Mixed Reality serves the user who needs to see both. The United States Marine Corps is embarking on this new reality to enhance their trade space analysis tool known as FACT  Framework for Assessing Cost and Technology. With the upgrade to Mixed Reality in FACT, users view new designs (where we want to go) overlaid on existing systems (where we are) to best understand design options and implications. This paper details the development process and reviews potential future applications of Mixed Reality.
