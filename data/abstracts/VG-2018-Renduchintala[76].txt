Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood. Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl, or walk as early as other children their age. Conductive Education (CE) is a multi-disciplinary therapy that immerses children with cerebral palsy in feedback rich environments to promote coordinated functioning and ultimately an acceptable level of independence. The system leverages the MQTT protocol and HTML5 and WebGL technology to create a secure, easily accessible, scalable, real time responsive game environment.
