The population of small maritime vessels within and around the United States greatly outnumbers the number of law enforcement vessels available to police them. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed the Maritime Simulation Model (MSM) under an interagency agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to understand concepts of operations used by law enforcement to encounter small vessel maritime traffic. MSM was implemented as an agent based model in Repast Simphony with limited behaviors and physics. DHS wanted to enhance the physics and behaviors without a significant rewrite or redevelopment of the original code. Under contract with DHS, Engility Corporation migrated MSM into the Defense Threat Reduction Agencys federated modeling and simulation architecture to improve physics, enhance artificial intelligence, and federate with other detection models. Improving the fidelity of simulations required overcoming hardware resource limitations, terrain correlation issues, and assumptions made based on how agents behave in one model framework versus another.
