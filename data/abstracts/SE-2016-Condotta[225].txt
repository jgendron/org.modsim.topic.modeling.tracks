Emergent air vehicles types, such as unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), have the potential to augment the benefits of aviation by offering new capabilities. However, the current air traffic management (ATM) system, which relies on centralized air traffic control (ATC), cannot accommodate the integration of these new vehicles with preexisting aircraft. Through the Autonomous Departure and Arrival Procedures and Technology (ADAPT) concept, NASA Langley Research Center (NASA-LaRC) will systematically develop a solution that incorporates these new vehicles into a decentralized ATC environment. NASA will construct a set of protocols, or Rules of the Road (ROR), which are the logical rules that each air vehicle uses to self-manage operations for travel. To assist NASA with its experimental testing, the 2015-2016 Old Dominion University Modeling and Simulation Engineering Capstone Team will design and develop a simulation software framework, FAST (Framework for ADAPT Simulated Testing), which incorporates agent-based modeling and simulation support components. FAST alone provides functionality for many- vehicle flight simulation and travel mission completion, but requires NASA to complete the simulation through the addition of ROR-related logic to add conflict detection and resolution capability. FAST and the other tools developed by the capstone class will allow NASA to quickly implement, test, and analyze their ROR models. This paper discusses the complete software architecture, which includes and supports FAST, and the capabilities of the system components. It will discuss each component, individually, of the FAST architecture which includes a vehicle repository, input editor, simulator, output analyzer, and visualization tool.
