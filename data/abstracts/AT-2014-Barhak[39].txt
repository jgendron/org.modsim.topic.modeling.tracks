Clinical trial population information is typically restricted and individual data is not public. However, clinical trial results and population statistics are regularly published. It is possible to reconstruct mock individual data populations from these statistics to support disease modeling and better understand the population characteristics. This can help in both planning and analysis of trial results on a larger information scope involving multiple clinical trials. A fairly simple example of generating an individual population from aggregate statistics is as follows: generate 1000 individuals such that their mean age would be 61 with SD of 8.2 and mean age at diagnosis of diabetes would be 53. Even this simple example has constraints such as age at diagnosis of diabetes should be lower than the individual age which will cause a skewed distribution. Reconstructing a mock population that matches clinical trial statistics is more complex and involves multiple objectives and interactions between statistics. This work improves the Monte Carlo abilities of the MIcro Simulation Tool (MIST) to generate populations from statistics by introducing genetic algorithms supported by the INSPYRED software package. The genetic algorithm improves the accuracy of the reconstructed population and better handles skewed distributions and constraints.
