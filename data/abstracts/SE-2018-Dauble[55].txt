In response to an increasingly complex and uncertain operational environment, the United States Military requires innovative technologies to enable adaptable, full-spectrum operational training. Live, Virtual, Constructive, and Gaming (LVC&G) environments offer desirable solutions to a myriad of training challenges and support safe, multi- faceted training to improve readiness at the point-of-need. LVC&G offers high return on investment from saving assets for actual operations, lessening overall logistical costs and planning timetables, increasing flexibility and training dynamics, and reducing preventable mishaps during range training. However, often the adaptability and scalability offered by traditional solutions are hampered by closed, stovepipe software applications. In this paper, we will review the use of commercial gaming technology as a development tool and software runtime to address some of these obstacles. Specifically, we will analyze the use of Unity, a commercial game engine, for multi-domain image generation in scalable LVC&G military exercises at the individual, unit, leadership, and international levels. Operation Blended Warrior (OBW), an annual LVC&G event, will be reviewed to highlight the current state of the industry and technical challenges associated with integrating non-traditional gaming technologies into full-scale exercises. Key interoperability and scalability issues including asset reusability and standards-based communication protocols, typically absent in commercial game engines, will be discussed. This paper will offer Industry and Government forward-leaning suggestions to best position both to understand and leverage disruptive commercial gaming technologies in combination with simulation middleware to engineer innovative capabilities to modernize training for operational readiness.
