The magnitude of current through a conical nanochannel filled with an electrolyte solution depends on the polarity of the applied bias, indicating an asymmetric diode-like current-voltage (I-V) curve. This kind of phenomenon refers to current rectification and it indicates that there is a preferential direction for ion flow in the asymmetrical nanochannels. In this study, the rectification phenomenon through an asymmetrical nanochannel simultaneously subjected to an electric field and electrolyte concentration gradient is numerically investigated. A mathematical model consisting of the PNP equations has been developed. The obtained simulation results are in great agreement with the literature. In this research, the effect of the imposed electrolyte concentration gradient on the current rectification has been studied for the first time.
