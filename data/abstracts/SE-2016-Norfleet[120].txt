The current generation of synthetic simulated tissues in medical trainers is adequate for basic training, but they often fall short of delivering the fidelity necessary to build muscle memory. This problem has been overlooked by users because there is no standard method for describing how tissues should behave during medical procedures. The Department of Defense is working to develop tissue performance requirements that can be referenced during the development of future generations of medical simulations. The first step is to determine how closely synthetic tissues mimic the behaviors of the human tissues being simulated. This paper compares mechanical properties of human pleura against simulated pleura used in thoracostomy training. Thoracostomy, or chest tube insertion, is a surgical intervention where a tube is inserted between the ribs to drain fluid and air from the chest cavity. Without it, pressure builds in the chest and eventually the lungs will collapse. A collapsed lung, or tension pneumothorax, is the second most common preventable cause of death on the battlefield according to the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) curriculum. Many commercial medical simulators train this procedure and nearly all of them use synthetic materials to simulate the haptic pop felt when the pleura is breached. This paper measures the mechanical properties of those materials and compares them against the same mechanical properties measured from human pleura. Comparisons include tensile stress, stretch ratio, and strain energy density. This paper builds on the procedures and results presented by Norfleet, Lobo Fenoglietto, and Mazzeo at MODSIM 2015.
