Eye-tracking has traditionally been used as a means of measuring eye scanning behavior while reading, interacting with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) or in providing a user interface for assistive devices for individuals who may not be able to use more standard input mechanisms. As the technology matures there is extensive interest in using eye-tracking as a control mechanism, either augmenting or completely replacing an existing user interface device. Use of eye-tracking technology has the potential of increasing the control bandwidth between a user and a device, something that can be a critical advantage in complex interfaces. At the same time low accuracy or poorly designed interfaces could have a negative effect on ease of use. Thus, it is important to gain an understanding of how eye- tracking accuracy can affect the performance of different control tasks under various control approaches. In this paper preliminary results are presented on eye-tracking accuracy in a simple GUI button selection task with and without cursor feedback. This research is a precursor to a larger study that investigates eye-tracking as a means of controlling a tele-operated robot in a simulated search and the results will be used to optimize the design of discrete selection events in the GUI for robot control.
