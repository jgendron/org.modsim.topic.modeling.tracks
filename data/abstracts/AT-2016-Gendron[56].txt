There are many misconceptions about the benefits and application of pilot studies, but conducting tests without performing them in advance can be a costly mistake. One misconception is that access to test assets is necessary. Although it can be challenging to run a pilot study without the actual resources used in the test, simulation provides a means to overcome this and validate the effectiveness of the intended design. This paper presents the approach and results from a pilot study enabled through simulation. The project underlying this study is a test event investigating process performance. The team realized the value of incorporating a pilot study, but access to the systems and operators was not possible. They innovated a technique by combining Markov transition state modeling with process mining footprints to generate simulated data. Although simulated, its realism proved sufficient to inform a data collection plan optimized for a small team, and it indicated the main test was feasible. By analyzing the resulting data against investigative questions, the data collection strategy was refined in ways unforeseen before simulating the process. The pilot study clarified assumptions, refined instrumentation, and assessed the utility of expected data. These results demonstrate the power of pilot designs, even when resources are not available. This paper closes with insights extensible to other types of analyses and particularly those involving testing and process mining.
