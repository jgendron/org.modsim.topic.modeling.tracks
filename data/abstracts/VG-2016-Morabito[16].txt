As the training industry continues to work with budget constraints, full-mission simulators (FMS) with massive worlds and next-generation graphics seem completely out of scope. Applying techniques from the way video games are rendered allows companies to focus their efforts and work toward delivering high-value simulations at a fraction of the cost. When a game engine renders an amazingly large, beautiful city in sandbox games such as Grand Theft Auto, players do not notice that all the assets in the distance are rendered at a much lower fidelity than the assets and models that are closest to them. This culling process allows the player to see the important aspects in high fidelity, while remaining immersed in a world where the background has been rendered more efficiently. Targeted Fidelity is the concept of applying this process to training and simulation. Targeted Fidelity provides an increase in scope, model resolution, or other details in areas required by learning objectives, while at the same time allowing for a decrease in scope, model resolution, and so on, for less important areas. Rendering the secondary and tertiary objectives at lower fidelity allows students to continue their immersion in the simulation, while drastically lowering the cost of the training product itself. Applying the concept of Targeted Fidelity to graphics, instructional systems design, hardware, and peripherals will focus the deliverable product much more accurately, providing more cost-effective solutions.
