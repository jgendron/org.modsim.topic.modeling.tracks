The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) element at NASA Langley Research Center desires a process for evaluating and comparing designs for medical workstations capable of supporting long-duration human space exploration . The authors, as part of their senior capstone design experience, are jointly charged with both designing an evaluation process and implementing a prototype of that process as a proof of concept. A key component of the evaluation process is a simulation having the capability to assign quantitative values to dynamic performance measures. Dynamic performance measures are evaluated by observing the conduct of an activity or task over a period of time. Examples of dynamic performance measures include the time required to complete a task, or the volume/shape of the spatial envelope required to perform a task. The design team has determined that using a discrete event simulation, in which avatars are monitored while performing representative medical tasks, is the best approach for evaluating dynamic performance measures. The focus of this paper is the process of defining those metrics, as well as the approach to evaluating the dynamic metrics of the corresponding simulation.
