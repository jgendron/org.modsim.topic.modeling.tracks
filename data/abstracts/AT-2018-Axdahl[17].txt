For domains where data are difficult to obtain due to human or resource limitations, an emphasis is needed to efficiently explore the dimensions of information spaces to acquire any given response of interest. Many disciplines are still making the transition from brute force, dense, full factorial exploration of their information spaces to a more efficient design of experiments approach; the latter being in use successfully for many decades in agricultural and automotive applications. Although this transition is still incomplete, groundwork must be laid for incorporating the next generation of algorithms to adaptively explore the information space in response to data collected, as well as any resulting empirical models (i.e., metamodels). The methodology in the present work was to compare metamodel quality using a fixed sampling technique compared to an adaptive sampling technique based on metamodel variance. In order to quantify metamodeling errors, a delta method was used to provide quantitative model variance estimates. The present methodology was applied to a design space with an air-breathing engine performance response. It was shown that competitive metamodel quality with lower associated error could be achieved for an adaptive sampling technique for the same level of effort as a fixed, a priori sampling technique.
