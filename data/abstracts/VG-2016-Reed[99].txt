This research is a continuation and expansion of our previous analysis of the efficacy of lightweight, constructive, game-based simulation. While the U.S. Army continues to employ constructive and game-based simulation for training, minimal research has been conducted on the training efficacy of these classes of simulation. The Linguistic Geometry Real-time Adversarial Intelligence and Decision-making (LG-RAID) simulation is a lightweight, game- based, constructive simulation that exploits novel game theory to create intelligent, predictive and tactically-correct Courses of Action (COAs) for exercise participants at the company echelon and below. The primary goal of this study remained unchanged; to examine the training effectiveness of the U.S. Army's LG-RAID simulation in an operationally relevant environment. Qualified Soldiers were randomly assigned to one of two training treatments (LG-RAID simulation or a traditional planning method) and tasked to develop, plan and brief a tactically sound operational mission in order to empirically assess the training effectiveness of LG-RAID. The independent variable was training treatment. Dependent variables included performance and individual survey responses. Experimentation was conducted on multiple occasions at Fort Benning, GA and performance was evaluated by accredited U.S. Army instructors. Results of this study continue to indicate that the LG-RAID simulation may be an effective training simulation.
