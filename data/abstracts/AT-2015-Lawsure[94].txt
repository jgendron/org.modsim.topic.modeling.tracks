Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are becoming an essential part of a manufacturing organizations ability to monitor and ensure its strategic health. Furthermore, selecting the right mix of KPIs, in line with an organizations strategic goals, is also essential. This paper outlines the development of a web-enabled database tool to support a selection method for KPIs for manufacturing which was developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the method, KPIs are selected to effectively achieve certain criteria for a target manufacturing process. Subject matters experts use the tool to perform scoring of criteria weights and KPI/criteria pairs. These scores are analyzed and iterated in order to determine balanced KPI sets, which best satisfy the chosen criteria and the stated critical objectives. A prototype tool, a web-enabled database, was developed for the purpose of facilitating the pilot implementation of the NIST methodology at select manufacturing plants. This paper provides a description of the NIST methodology and the tool development.
