Big data is a proven asset within the hospitality industry  where might modeling and simulation further increase the value of data housed in hospitality data systems? Many industries find insights from big data and act on them to realize benefits. The hospitality industry uses data to focus marketing campaigns, enhance customer experience, optimize internal operations, and increase operating profits. This paper provides an overview of how hospitality sectors are using big data in a high stakes business. Restaurants represent a large sector of the hospitality industry. Restaurateurs manage operations ranging from multi-kitchen, four-star hotels to locally-owned restaurants. Trends in the restaurant sector show increased use of technologies to manage those operations. Mindful of the technologies restaurateurs use, this paper provides a look at big data within the context of these technologies and how predictive analytics is a leading capability for analyzing information. It highlights challenges restaurateurs faced in becoming data centric and viewing the switching costs as an investment. As data-centric organizations mature, shifting from predictive analytics to prescriptive analytics is a natural step. Modeling and simulation is a powerful approach to push beyond prediction and provide restaurateurs with insights they can act upon. Like big data, modeling and simulation solutions will need to overcome challenges before restaurateurs adopt them. This paper closes with three overarching questions to begin the conversation with restaurateurs and stimulate ways in which simulation professionals may provide answers.
