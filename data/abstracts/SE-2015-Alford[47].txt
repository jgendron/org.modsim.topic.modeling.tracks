Estimating extreme responses for ships and other marine structures is critical in the design process. Long-term simulations can, theoretically, capture extreme responses, but long-term simulations using robust, nonlinear computer programs are not computationally feasible in the early design process. An alternative is to use short, tailored simulations that create statistically equivalent extreme responses. This requires an accurate reconstruction of expected extreme sea conditions. Extreme responses can be estimated using a variety of processes, including the Design Loads Generator (DLG). Assuming a vessel response can be approximated as a sum of Fourier amplitudes with random phase angles, the DLG calculates sets of random phase angles for the seaway that result in a given extreme response or design event. The corresponding incident wave phase angles are calculated from the response phase angles and the incident wave train profile can be calculated. Depending on the response in question, the incident wave train profile from the DLG can range from a single, large wave to a group of 5-10 waves of similar frequency and amplitude. Accurately recreating these deterministic wave trains in a nonlinear seaway is a crucial step to integrating the DLG with a high fidelity CFD program. A common practice employs linear wave theory to shift the phase angles according to the location of the wavemaker. The shifted phase angles can then be used to drive a wavemaker with the intent of producing the desired wave train at the specified point downstream. However, nonlinearities in wave propagation result in inaccurately generated wave trains as measured at the specified point downstream. A recently developed method for the phase shift process allows for improved simulation of nonlinear water-wave evolution. This paper applies this method to increasingly large waves and assesses its performance in the limit of extremely large waves.
