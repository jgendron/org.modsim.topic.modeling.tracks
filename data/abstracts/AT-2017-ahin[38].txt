This study reports on an evaluation tool for instructors of a non-traditional vocational program and the effectiveness of providing frequent formative feedback to instructors based on data collected from students. A comprehensive survey on instructional effectiveness was administered across eight urban sites across the USA. Fidelity measures were taken in administrating the survey, which enabled uniform procedures in collecting data and for reporting the data. The vocational training consisted of three 7-week modules that spanned 6 months. Around 3000 students participate in the vocational training program. Students completed the survey after each module. The instructors received the unpacked feedback from the survey administrators in digestible format, as well as through discussions with their academic supervisors. The goal of the feedback framework was to enhance accountability between students and instructors, providing instructional transparency, and narrowing the lag time variance in acting on student feedback. Unlike broad summative assessments carried out at the end of trainings, the content and frequency of the feedback in formative evaluations offered instructors quick insights into their practices and the opportunity to adjust their teaching to students learning styles. The survey was designed based on established educational theories and practices, and instructors were given feedback based on the practices included in the survey. This study showcases the usefulness of formative assessments of instructors based on quantitative and qualitative evaluations over a six-month cycle. Results indicated that the instructors employed suggested teaching practices more frequently in later modules compared to their performance after the first module.
