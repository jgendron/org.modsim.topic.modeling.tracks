We model the evolution of a complex technology in a specific geographical region by treating it as a living organism evolving genetically in an ecosystem. A simulation of the model is carried out by data-mining all patents issued in that region to inventions using that specific technology. Each patent provides a set of genes from a possible genome of the organism, with the genes being specific technological areas that the patent office uses to classify the functionalities of an invention. The results of the analysis can be used for decision support and business intelligence by providing a method of genetically engineering a technology to make it more fit for its local environment. Using the model, we examine how the genetic makeup of an organism changes over time as specific genes are selected by its environment. The genes collected from the patents provide a picture of how the species is evolving. The present simulation studies the evolution of Modeling and Simulation (MANDS) itself, with the state of Virginia as the local environment. In previous studies using the model, it was shown that environmental factors influence the species genome over time to generate organisms with specific capabilities, with MANDS in Michigan supporting the automotive industry and MANDS in Texas supporting the energy sector. Thus, the model leverages big data to understand how a complex technology evolves, how the regional environment provides supportive conditions for gene expression, and how to genetically modify the complex technology for future survival and growth.
