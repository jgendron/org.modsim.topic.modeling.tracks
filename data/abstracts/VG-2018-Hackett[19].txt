Tactical Combat Casualty Care Simulation (TC3Sim) is a serious game allowing trainees to practice TC3 procedures in a virtual environment. The current study had two primary objectives: to assess the technology acceptance of TC3Sim; and to determine the applicability of TC3Sim for medical providers who do not primarily focus on TC3, such as nurses or physicians. The study combined two common models of technology acceptance: the DeLone- McLean model of information system success (Delone & McLean, 2003) and the technology acceptance model (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). The study population was Air Force critical care nurses (n = 22) at the University of Cincinnati Hospital and focused on the following metrics: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intent to use, information quality, and system quality. Participants rated the TC3Sim platform positively across all metrics. Analyzing inter-correlation of the variables, the results showed that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were predictive of intent to use, consistent with similar studies. Information quality was a significant predictor of both perceived usefulness and intent to use. Notably, for many systems, such as E-commerce or webmail, information quality is not predictive of a participants intent to use the system (Iivari, 2005); however, this was not the case for the TC3Sim application. The strong correlation in this case suggests that training systems, in particular medical training systems, are more heavily judged on the quality of presented information. Finally, the positive perceptions towards TC3Sim suggest the platform can be broadly utilized across echelons of care, including atypical TC3 providers.
