The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of how a scientific, quantitative approach to historical analysis, supported by computer simulation may be used to further military analysis and historical research. It is argued that the key benefit is that as historians we are provided with a methodology that allows us to develop more precise questions (hypotheses), organise our data more effectively to answer them and to assess each hypothesis more thoroughly. The approach described is well within the reach of history enthusiasts as well as professional analysts and historians and so may appeal to a large audience.
