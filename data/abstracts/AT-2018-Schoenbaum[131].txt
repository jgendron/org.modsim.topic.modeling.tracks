Stochastic animal disease models produce large quantities of data outputs regarding the epidemiological and economic impacts of disease outbreaks across a range of outbreak possibilities. The amount and complexity of data outputs can increase exponentially as more iterations and scenarios are performed to address the modeling question(s) of interest. Once analyzed, simulated output data can be valuable to decision makers for assessing the effects of different control strategies on outbreak impact and informing policy. In order for animal disease spread models to be useful tools to support emergency preparedness activities, the model outputs must be effectively provided to decision makers in a timely fashion. Typically, the process of obtaining the model output data and its analysis can be the rate limiting step that prevents model output from being readily used to inform decision making, as this process is dependent on the analytical skill sets of the modeler and access to appropriate software. We developed a suite of epidemiologic analyses and interactive model output visualization and scenario comparison tools using the R program (R Core Team, 2017) that link seamlessly to the outputs of the Animal Disease Spread Model (ADSM), a freely available modeling tool that can support emergency preparedness activities. A demonstration of the developed analysis and visualization R tools will be presented, employing a use-case of how they can be applied by a modeler to evaluate control strategies for a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and present a summary and comparison of the model scenarios to a decision maker.
