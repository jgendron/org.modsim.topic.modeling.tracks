 C2 System Training Challenges for
NORAD and USNORTHCOM Missions â¢ UniqueC2systemsandsimulationmodels
â Expensive scenario development â¢ Isolated internal system simulations
â Single mission stimulus
â Limited participants
â¢ Crewsmemorizedthelimitedsetofscenarios
â Resulted in ânegative trainingâ
NORAD Bi-National mission: To conduct aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in the defense of North America.
USNORTHCOM mission: Partner to conduct homeland defense, civil support, and security cooperation to defend and secure the United States and its interests.

Affordable for Alternate and Trainer
  
 Initial Focus: Air Warning Training
â¢ Original work plan was revectored
â Leadership changed prioritization of primary C2 system to a new Remote Tactical Air Picture (RTAP) â No documentation; not feasible to emulate
â Command introduced a new Air Event Information Sharing Service (A/EISS)
â Stopped adaptation work on existing Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) to
directly stimulate the old primary system, Air Mission Evolution (AME)
â¢ Way-ahead â Virtualized training system
â Rather than emulating individual feeds into four local C2 systems, stepped
back one level to common source, Battle Control System (BCS)
â Virtualization of BCS and our C2 systems provided cost-effective replication with authentic processing, messages, and displays
â End result is an end-to-end air string representing inputs from military, FAA, and NAVCAN sensors through the NORAD sectorsâ BCS processing with outputs merged into Headquarterâs systems

â¢ AWSIM Model Operator dynamically stimulating virtualized BCS
â¢ Authentic BCS processing with outputs to virtualized NORAD C2 systems
â¢ Warfighter trains at operational workstation â added thin client hardware

Virtualization Benefits
View of training systems have same âLook/Touch/Feelâ as operational systems
Authentic processing and message content
Inherits many Cyber Security and Information Assurance characteristics â simplified approval for Authority to Operate
Virtual machines are âfilesâ
â Small footprint â AWSIM, four NORAD Sectorsâ BCS components and HQ C2 systems hosted on two virtualization servers
â Easily restored back to initial state
â Select files for software upgrades, mixing versions or ârevertingâ back

 Summary
Leveraged virtualization technology to enhance NORAD and USNORTHCOM C2 system training objectives
â â â
â â â
Dynamic scenario injection
Utilizes Serviceâs JLVC toolkit - AWSIM
Stimulates multiple C2 systems with authentic processing, messages, and displays
Initially deployed for local training, but scalable for distributed multi-echelon events
Affordably replicated in Alternate Command Center and Qualification Trainer
Expanding capabilities for synchronized air and missile event multi-mission training
