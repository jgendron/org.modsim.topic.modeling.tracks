   Every systems engineer knows about the six interrogatives: who, what, where, when, how, why. Engineers and technical managers also know what knowledge about each system has to for each phase of its life cycle, and that in each phase multiple team members and stakeholders are involved. The likelihood for communication break-downs and misunderstandings is already great for just one system and increases manifold in complex systems that are part of a portfolio. Semantic technologies allow for a more consistent approach to capture the expert knowledge associated with systems across their life cycles and provide an economical approach to enforce consistency and enable flexibility in domain specific engineering efforts. The key elements and enablers that ensure expert knowledge is captured and consistently composed and represented are ontologies, and rule sets, and reasoning logic. Ontologies have been identified as successful support to ensure semantic consistency. This paper evaluates what ontologies can do to successfully address the multi-dimensionality of complex systems engineering challenges and makes some recommendations how a general solution may look like.
