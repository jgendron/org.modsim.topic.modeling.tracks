Current simulation-based training focuses on hardware-based capabilities installed at forward deployed and designated military and civilian training sites. Learners must conform to training center schedules and resource limitations. These individual site installations require dedicated support for trainer operations, maintenance, network, and information assurance. Moreover, software updates and configuration changes are difficult and expensive to coordinate, given dispersed installations. Geographically dispersed learners need access to training more rapidly with reduced overhead and lifecycle costs. Ideally, these learners would have access to a broad- spectrum of training media, such as simulations, at their home-stations or training sites without the extensive infrastructure to support full simulation systems. The cloud, networked remote-servers accessed via the internet, may solve this problem by providing broad access while localizing infrastructureTraining on Demand (TOD). This paper gives a brief review of the current state-of-the-art in providing simulation-based training and the challenges in moving it to the cloud. We describe a solution that allows for platform-independent deployment of simulation and game-based training from tablets to personal computers over cellular, WIFI, and broadband network connections, whether government- or commercial-based. We conclude with use-case results and a discussion of future development-research required.
