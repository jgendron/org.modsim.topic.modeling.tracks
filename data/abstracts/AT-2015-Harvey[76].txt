The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is interested in understanding capabilities to encounter people crossing the borders between official ports of entry, and in determining the likelihood and probable areas where law enforcement officials can intercept a suspect, either on or off road. Engility Corporation, under contract with DHS, has developed a general purpose geospatial encounter model as a plugin for QGIS. This model takes into account law enforcement and adversary vehicle types, road networks, natural boundaries, elevation, and land type to quickly and efficiently generate triangular meshes to compute isochrones accurately over entire regions. These isochrones support a physics constrained, quantitative assessment of potential encounter capabilities. Novel modeling approaches were introduced to improve computational efficiency of modeling multiple law enforcement and adversary entities in a single scenario. The software can also aid in planning future force structure laydowns to detect illegal border crossings and off road searches.
