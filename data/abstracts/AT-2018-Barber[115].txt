A review of Decision Support Systems literature finds that such systems have historically been associated with managerial or industry long-term decision-making (Alter,1980). Decision Support Systems also refers to an academic field of research that involves designing and studying systems in their context of use (Schuffetal. 2011). This paper discusses the extension of the field to the support of decision-making for Combatting Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD). It describes the development of a scenario-based Decision Support Simulator (DSS) prototype using an iterative design approach that leverages a working group of subject matter experts to identify simulator and scenario requirements. The goal for the DSS is to enable decision makers to develop courses of action in response to crisis events by simulating response cells, logistics information, doctrine tactics, and procedures in a real-world context. At critical decision points during DSS scenarios, direct feedback and metacognitive prompting are presented as appropriate and key performance metrics are recorded for comprehensive after action review. Existing operational tools are leveraged to facilitate realistic scenario interactions. The goal is to unify disparate technologies and resources through a web interface that is extensible to multiple areas of expertise when dealing with crisis events. This paper details the approach to establishing the requirements of the design of a portable DSS prototype, including the CWMD scenario, instructional and system architecture, and assessment methodologies.
