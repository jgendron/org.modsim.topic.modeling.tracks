A review of Decision Support Systems literature finds that such systems have historically been associated with managerialorindustrylong-termdecision-making(Alter,1980).DecisionSupportSystemsalsoreferstoanacademic fieldofresearchthatinvolvesdesigningandstudyingsystemsintheircontextofuse(Schuffetal.2011). Thispaper dis cusses the extension of the field to the s upport of decision-making for Combatting W eapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD). It describes the development of a scenario-based Decision Support Simulator (DSS) prototype using an iterativedesignapproachthatleveragesaworkinggroupofsubjectmatterexperts toidentifysimulatorandscenario requirements. The goal for the DSS is to enable decision makers to develop courses of action in response to crisis eventsbysimulatingresponsecells,logisticsinformation,doctrine,tactics,andproceduresinareal-worldcontext.At critical decision points during DSS scenarios, direct feedback and metacognitive prompting are presented as appropriate and key performance metrics are recorded for comprehensive after action review.

This paper details the approach to establishing the requirements of the design of a portable DSS prototype, including the CWMD scenario,instructionaland systemarchitecture,and assessment methodologies.
