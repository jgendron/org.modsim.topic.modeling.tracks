Although aviation mishaps are relatively rare, such incidents are devastating due to the high probability of injury or death and financial loss. Factors such as spatial disorientation and lack of situational awareness are known root causes of many aviation mishaps and generally lack effective training. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that current training for such factors is typically confined to traditional methods (e.g., lectures)which typically deemphasizes kinesthetic learning. To address this significant challenge, Aptima has developed a scenario authoring tool for experiencing realistic renditions of aviation mishaps caused by spatial disorientation. The MASTER system enables aviation instructors to create immersive mishap scenarios from realistic mishap data and intuitive creation tools while providing multiple methods for media export (e.g., 360-degree video, virtual reality [VR]). Some of the common causal mishap illusions demonstrated by the MASTER system include the following: false/fixed horizons, black holes, and the somatogravic illusion. This approach aims to enhance training efficacy by providing multiple methods of immersive mishap replay along with a dedicated plan for evaluating the effectiveness of various training media. In summary, the anticipated components of the MASTER system work to streamline scenario authoring by aviation instructors and provide optimized training for typical aviation mishap factors. Although more work is needed, our preliminary work indicate that rapid scenario authoring is feasible and that immersive training mediasuch as VR can potentially increase training efficacy.
