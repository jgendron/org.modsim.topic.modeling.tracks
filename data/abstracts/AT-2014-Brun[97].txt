Many professionals are involved in the creation of Live, Virtual, Constructive, and Game (LVC&G) simulation environments and scenarios, from simulator programmers to subject matter experts. Currently, there is no systematic method for designing simulation events from these multiple perspectives. To meet this need, Aptima developed LVC&GAED (Assisted Experimental Designer), a decision support system that guides individuals through a ten step simulation-design process, from defining the research question or training goal, to choosing variables of interest and developing relevant measures. A knowledge database, populated by data from past simulations and their results, serves as the basis for an underlying model that recommends simulation configurations that address all relevant goals, while maximizing quality and minimizing cost. This prototype was designed to be usable by any individual, regardless of background, enabling them to create effective simulation designs quickly and efficiently. By utilizing all existing data and available tools, LVC&G-AED saves manpower, time, and financial resources.
