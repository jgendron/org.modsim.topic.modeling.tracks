A submarine hull join is the process of fitting and welding two large hull sections of a submarine into a single unit. Until now, the ability to predict dimensional shifts from initial cylinder fit-up through the final weld relied on the domain expertise of experienced shipbuilders. With an infinitesimal tolerance for each control point, the care put into these determinations was tedious and time-consuming. To improve efficiency, a predictive algorithm was built to learn optimal at-set coordinates from the behavior of prior joins. The algorithm took historical data from a series of Virginia Class Submarine joins, and used regression and statistical analysis to model control point shifts at each stage. Predictions were generated for the shifts in a Monte Carlo Simulation, and an Excel Solver was used to choose the at-set coordinates that minimized the probability of out-of-tolerance joins. The VCS C-Seam Analytics Platform (VCAP), written in R, employs graph theory and advanced statistical distribution fitting rules to fully automate this algorithm. The mathematics are hidden behind an intuitive user interface, passing the burden of modeling the data to the tool instead of the engineer. The platform greatly reduces the man hours needed to prepare for each join, enables speedy enhancements to the models predictive power, and births an algorithm that progressively gets smarter from both new data and the users ability to quickly tune its parameters.
