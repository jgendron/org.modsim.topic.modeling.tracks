Training sonar operators for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) in complex environments is challenging. Performance deficiencies are the product of errors in both analysis and employment. Experts use mental models to interpret displays and reason about the underlying scenario in order to perform analysis under uncertain conditions and achieve more optimal tactical-system employment. To accelerate the development of this expertise and improve the retention of proficiency, ARiA is developing the Environment for Surface ASW Interactive Learning (E-SAILTM). E-SAILTM enables operators to visualize the environmental and tactical scenario that resulted in the received sonar signals while allowing them to directly manipulate that scenario and observe the outcome of the manipulation. Here we discuss the theoretical basis for the E-SAILTM learning approach and overview development of the visualization environment and graphical user interface that deploys on tactical hardware and interfaces with tactical displays, tactical decision aids, embedded simulation-based training (SBT), and environmental databases through a high- performance asynchronous messaging library and software-independent interface specification.
