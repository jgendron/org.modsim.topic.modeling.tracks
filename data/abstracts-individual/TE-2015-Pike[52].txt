The novel Enders Game, while a work of fiction, presents a fascinating case study in how modeling and simulation can be applied for both individual and collective training. In addition, Enders Game is a great text, and practically required reading, for modeling and simulation professionals. Ender Wiggin, the fictional hero of Orson Scott Cards Enders Game, knew the value of simulation in the realm of training as well as anyone. Time and time again during his training regimen, he utilized simulations to test himself and his team up to, and at times beyond, their breaking points. Ultimately, the learning environment in their schoolhouse provided Ender and his team the tools for success. This paper will explore lessons learned from Enders use of simulation to train individually and as a team, and review Enders Game as a modeling and simulation case study. (Naturally, this paper contains spoilers about the novel).
