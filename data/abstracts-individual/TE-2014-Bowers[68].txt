Interest in using game technologies to improve workplace skills has been growing in recent years. While there are several potential advantages for a game-based training approach (cf. Cannon-Bowers & Bowers, 2011), a number of challenges confront developers who seek to create the technology. The greatest challenge is the need to rethink and integrate several traditional processes and resources, including front-end analysis, developing and managing art assets, programing within a game engine, play testing prototype versions of the game, and ultimately measuring training effectiveness. Each of these must be balanced against cost and schedule constraints. In this paper, we discuss an innovative, comprehensive approach to developing game based training on a large scale for the Navys Littoral Combat Ship, and demonstrate how it can be generalized to other applications.
