The Joint Staff (JS) J-7 is developing Joint Training Tools (JTT) as modular simulation services to reside within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE). The JTSE will be a cloud-based, web-enabled, enterprise environment providing scalable, on-demand, and operationally relevant training for military forces. The user orientated JTT design will emphasize ease of use by making the underlying tools processes more transparent, and output displays more understandable. While battlefield outcomes cannot be predicted with accuracy, components influencing the outcome can be analyzed to determine possible outcomes. Campaign planning incorporates force analysis including deployment, missions, equipment, capabilities, and environmental factors to determine if a desired outcome is achievable in a given situation. JTSE JTT utilize force structure data organized by Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) codes and include combat powers based upon equipment, training, and other military factors influencing battlefield results. The Combat Adjudication Service (CAS) uses this information to forecast reasonable outcomes of combat engagements represented in training environments. CAS performs combat adjudications as actions during runtime during event execution or as a data collection service to aid the training audience when employing forces in a synthetic training event. This paper provides a generalized review of how data from force structure is blended with equipment and environmental factors to forecast potential battlefield outcomes.
