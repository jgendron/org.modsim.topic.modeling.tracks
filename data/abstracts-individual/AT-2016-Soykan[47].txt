Even a moderately sized real-life runway scheduling problem tends to be too complex to be solved by analytical methods where the proposed mathematical models for this problem all belong to the complexity class of NP-Hard in a strong sense. Therefore, it is only possible to solve practical runway scheduling problems using mathematical programming methods by making a large number of simplifications and assumptions. As a result, most of the analytical models proposed in the literature suffer from too much abstraction and, in turn, not much applicability in practice. However, simulation-based methods have the capability to characterize complex and stochastic real-life runway systems in detail, as well as cope with several constraints and multiple objectives, which are important factors in practice. With a simulation-based optimization (SbO) approach where a discrete event simulation model is integrated with an optimization algorithm, the search for Pareto-optimal solutions can be done conveniently. Due to its large and unstructured search space, finding exact Pareto-optimal solutions to such multi-objective optimization problem is computationally intractable; given that such solutions need to be found in a reasonable timeframe, metaheuristic algorithms are the best option to pursue. In this study, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on scatter search (SS), which takes advantage of the structural details of the problem, and uses a dynamic update mechanism to produce high-quality solutions and a rebuilding strategy to promote diversity, is proposed and presented. SS-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms seem to be a promising research direction due to its efficiency and effectiveness in finding a set of non-dominated solutions in a SbO framework with multiple objectives. The experimental results that evaluate the proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithms performance in terms of both diversity of solutions and their proximity to the Pareto frontier are also presented.
