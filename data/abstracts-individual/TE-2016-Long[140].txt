The Armys Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) has described plans for modernizing Army training in documents such as the Army Learning Model (ALM, TRADOC PAM 525-8-2). The ALM calls for increasing the personalization of the soldier learning process so that training is tailored to the individual soldier throughout his/her career. In our previous efforts to address this goal, we conducted research to determine the extent to which using an adaptive training approach would improve soldier performance in unstabilized gunnery simulators. Using the Experience API (xAPI) data specification, performance data from an individual gunner was used to adapt crew training. We compared performance between crews that received an adaptive curriculum based on the gunners performance in the individual gunnery trainer and crews that received a standard curriculum without adaptive elements. Our research suggests that using an adaptive training curriculum led to a significant reduction in the amount of time to train with comparable final qualification scores. While the data is promising, the applicability of the results is limited in that the crew training was adapted based on the performance of the gunner, not the entire crew. This paper describes the implementation of a fully adaptive crew curriculum and the study for validation with active duty soldiers. In addition to assessing training efficiency, we will assess the extent to which adaptive training improves team knowledge. We predict adaptive training will not only result in more effective training for the individuals in the crew but also for the crew as a cohesive unit.
