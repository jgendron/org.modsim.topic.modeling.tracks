With the growth of social media, the value of text-based information continues to increase. It is difficult to analyze a large corpus of text to discover the structure within the data using computational methods. Alan Turing (1950) opens his influential article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" with the statement, "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'" (p. 433). Overall, this Turing Test has become a basis of natural language processing. The essence of this project is to take a corpus of text and build a predictive model to present a user with a prediction of the next likely word based on their input. A key aspect of the paper is discussion of techniques balancing accuracy and scalability for large data sets. This paper provides the analysis decisions used to develop that predictive text model for a corpus of over 500,000 blog articles. The resultant model exists as a web-based data product that allows for customizable user reporting. Additionally, the work presented in this project follows the tenets of reproducible research and all code is available in an open-source repository to enable readers to review the approach, reproduce the results, and collaborate to enhance the model.
