Test and evaluation of autonomous vehicle software using classical testing techniques is difficult because the software often is complex and designed to exceedingly high safety standards, making thorough testing infeasible. In addition, autonomous software generally contains non-deterministic components and statistical algorithms, making test results non-repeatable and difficult to interpret. Current test and evaluation approaches for autonomous systems place the vehicles in various operating scenarios to observe their behavior. However, this means that extensive testing must be delayed until a vehicle prototype is ready to operate in a physical environment. The purpose of this paper is to examine the benefits of utilizing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to facilitate full system testing throughout all phases of the design and development process. Early in the design process, system testing is conducted with virtual system components. As the design progresses, real system components are augmented with virtual components until final testing is possible using all real components. The approach is based on a new software framework and use of modeling and simulation to seamlessly incorporate VR and AR components with real components. The paper describes the software framework and explores requirements and constraints associated with this testing approach.
