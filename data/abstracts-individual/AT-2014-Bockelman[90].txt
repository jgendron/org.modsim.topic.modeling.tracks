Lifecycle cost analysis and Return-on-Investment (ROI) forecasts, are important processes associated with systems engineering and its sub-discipline, Human-Systems Integration (HSI). The Office of the Secretary of Defense (and many other Defense organizations) mandate the use of HSI, and analysis and acquisition efforts that apply HSI practices are more likely to be successful (e.g., Pew et al., 2007). Our team is presently investigating best practices for applying such evaluation techniques to medical training simulation systems as part of a larger effort focused on the U.S. Army. In this paper, we will share our generalizable best practices that developers and project engineers should consider in their own system initiatives. We offer these suggestions in order to encourage fellow medical simulation researchers and developers to use similar analysis and reporting methodologies, which will ultimately enhance comparability and clarity across the military and medical simulation-based training community.
