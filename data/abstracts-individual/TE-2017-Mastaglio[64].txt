MYMIC Simulations and Orbital ATK developed an immersive virtual reality demonstration environment to potentially train personnel on rocket fuel mixing procedures because Orbital ATK needed an effective way to provide immersive, effective training on hazardous operations. MYMIC and Orbital ATK developed a concept prototype using a head-mounted display to deliver a fully immersive 3D training experience. The implementation integrates Oculus Rift and Unity 3D with an Xbox360 controller. Beta testing of the prototype was positive and constructive realism was experienced; trainees attempted to reach out and touch portrayed objects as well as dodge ones that were too close. The training incorporates a virtual instructor avatar that orients the trainee. Lessons learned as to the efficacy of using virtual reality for training scenarios and development challenges are discussed.
