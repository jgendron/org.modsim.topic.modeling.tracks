Training humans to recognize cyberspace operations and respond rapidly and effectively is imperative, because mistakes have immediate consequences. The ever-evolving complexity of the combined cyber / kinetic battlefield drives a need to simulate engagements in high fidelity where each domain affects the other. We present a new simulation approach that integrates real and simulated cyberspace operations, wired and wireless virtual networks, live and virtual equipment and applications, and traditional kinetic warfare training simulators into a full, instrumented, synthetic cyber warfare training environment. The system allows trainee performance centered on awareness, reaction time and correct action (at all levels), along with ability to work through a degraded cyberspace environment and complete a mission, to be monitored and evaluated. We include an example of how cyberspace operations, and human misunderstanding of the operations, can seriously affect a mission outcome.
