During the Cold War, many people around the world felt the immense threat of nuclear warfare. Even as tensions calmed, the development of nuclear arsenals did not. Growth in nuclear weapon testing, political instability, and the increase in terrorist activity make war and war casualties a global concern. The purpose of this project was to simulate, through NetLogo, changes in the world population under a variety of war scenarios. Data about the current population and growth rate for each country that came from the CIA World Factbook were put into a shapefile, which is a geographic information system file. Casualty data from World War I and World War II were also collected and integrated into the shapefile. The program applies the natural growth rate and, if a battle took place, the coefficients derived from Lanchesters Theory of Warfare to the population and updates the map with the population change. The Lanchesters Theory of Warfare uses historical battles and past causalities data. The user can specify the initial soldier amount for both sides of a battle and the factors for each, such as the weapon efficiency, which are used in Lanchesters Theory of Warfare. Furthermore, the user can choose between the World War I data and the World War II data. This process is repeated for each tick, which is the count of days that has passed in the simulation. While the population will inevitably decrease in the case of a war, the different coefficients of war have different impacts on the population.
