The ability to produce a rapid After Action Review (AAR) capability provides objective data for evaluation and expands learner experience. Current video feedback does not provide a complete picture of the tactical situation during training, nor is it immediately available for evaluation. Cameras may not be positioned properly or a critical event may be blocked from view. Individual positions relative to potential enemy fire are not recorded. Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) technology combined with position-tracking software provides an effective method to produce immediate AARs. Position-tracking software and LiDAR technology when fused with digital imaging technology can capture both tactical and clinical skills to provide a more comprehensive audio/visual AAR capability with automatic scoring of performance. This capability can be used in conjunction with the Medical Training Evaluation Systems (MTES) assessment checklists currently fielded at the U.S. Army Medical Simulation Training Centers (MSTC). The result is an immediate playback of performance correlated to assessment scores for training and evaluation. Preliminary field-testing showed that LiDAR is capable of directing multiple cameras to track important actions of learners during a field training exercise. The position-tracking software accurately detected the persons of interest during a training event and cameras tracked their actions for the duration of the exercise. The AAR system successfully integrated the LiDAR data, video feeds, and skill assessment checklist to provide a fully integrated AAR system that provided all collected data in a simple user interface. Students compared the system to watching post-game footage of sports events to improve their performance. Instructors were able to pinpoint correct and incorrect actions to further educate the class and found the system to be valuable addition to training.
