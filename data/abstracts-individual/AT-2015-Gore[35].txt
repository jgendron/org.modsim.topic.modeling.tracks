Modeling under uncertainty has been of paramount importance, as quantitative methods of risk analysis have been developed to evaluate, prevent and respond to bioterror threats. Our simulation platform, Terrisk, improves risk assessment capabilities by providing modelers with novel means to: (1) capture incomplete and conflicting information about bioterror threats and (2) propagate that captured uncertainty to simulation outputs. Terrisk achieves these capabilities by supporting computation through three mathematical frameworks: probability theory, probability boxes, and Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. The inclusion of the latter two frameworks (probability boxes and Dempster-Shafer theory) is novel. They offer alternatives to traditional probability theory, which enables incomplete and conflicting information about model inputs to be captured and propagated to outputs. This capability of Terrisk facilitates decision-making because it provides more insight into possible model outcomes by more accurately reflecting what is known about model inputs.
