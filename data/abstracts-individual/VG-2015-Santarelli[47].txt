Because the number one preventable cause of death on the battlefield is due to extreme blood- loss from extremity wounds, a low-cost, scalable training solution to prepare every Solider in the use of tourniquets has the potential to save numerous lives on the battlefield. In response to this need, the HapMed system was developed to provide scalable, easy-to-use tourniquet application training to combat medics. HapMed address complex training challenges using a blended training solution encompassing information, demonstration, hands-on practice, and feedback. The purpose of the paper is to provide overall background on HapMed design requirements, illustrate recent advances to the system including a mobile controller application, and to describe the recent lessons learned through feedback garnered from HapMed end-users utilizing it in classroom combat lifesaver courses last year. HapMed provides a practical example of utilizing a blended design strategy to augment simulation-based training with games.
