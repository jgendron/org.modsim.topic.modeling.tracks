Data sharing is a critical capability that enables the global integration of military forces to combat trans-regional, multi-domain, multi-functional threats. Interoperable command and control systems are prerequisite for a common strategic understanding which promotes unity of effort and effective mission execution. Enabling the warfighter to make decisions and take action at the speed of the problem requires a robust flow of information by accessing and processing authoritative data sources. Secure data sharing is essential to achieving interdependent joint/coalition forces. Due to its distributed nature, data sharing cannot be acquired as a commodity, nor used as an individual weapon system. Unfortunately, there is no single DOD data sharing system, per se. Rather, using standardization and reuse, data sharing must be incorporated into the requirements development, acquisition, and sustainment phases of complex warfighting information system capabilities. Joint Staff (JS) J-6 Deputy Directorate for Cyber and Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) Integration (DD C5I) Data and Services Division (DSD) operates within an established Joint Command and Control capability development framework that includes governance, standardized information exchange, and authoritative data source visibility and access. Disparate data producing and consuming systems develop their data service capabilities within a standardized framework to fulfill data sharing needs for decision makers. This paper will describe the DSD activities, challenges, and the way ahead to advance an interdependent joint force by evolving and horizontally integrating interdependent data services as critical joint/coalition data sharing capabilities.
