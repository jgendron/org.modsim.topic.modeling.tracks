Effective weaponization of direct-fire remote and unmanned systems involves a complex interaction between warfighter and weapon system. To better understand the feasibility of such systems, a tele-operated and supervised autonomous (SA) remote weapon station simulator was used to conduct a series of warfighter experiments to validate the SA fire control methodology as a future system concept. Simulation and analysis are used to investigate the capabilities and limitations of SA, and benefits of SA as compared to tele-operation as a method of weapon system control. This paper presents the experiment design, modelling and simulation approach, and results of this study conducted with both civilians, and operational warfighters. Results indicate a normalization, and overall increase in measured operator performance in combat scenarios utilizing an ideal SA combat system as compared to ideal manual operation, however also indicate that peak performance of adept manual operators may exceed that of semi-automated performance.
