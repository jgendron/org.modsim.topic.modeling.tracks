The United States Coast Guard is researching a firehouse type staffing structure for pilots standing watch at the National Capital Region Air Defense Facility (NCRADF). This facility supports the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) providing immediate air protection from low and slow flying threats in the Washington, DC area. This watch currently requires heavy staffing levels to guard the airspace twenty-four hours a day/ year- round. More efficient options are being explored, including the firehouse model which consists of a repetitive cycle of duty days and days off. For this minimal staffing level to be successful, it will need to provide the pilots with adequate flight time and fill all the required watch positions. To test the new firehouse model, a simulation was coded in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) within Microsoft Excel. The results of the simulation showed a 0% probability that the new model provides adequate staffing to support the national defense mission. Additionally, the staffing structure did not provide the pilots enough flight hours thus negatively impacting the pilots proficiency.
