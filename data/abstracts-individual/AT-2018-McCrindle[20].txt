Modeling and Simulation techniques have evolved tremendously over the years. But a significant gap remains between the creation of analytical insights and delivering effective, actionable information to non-analytics enabled stakeholders. The last mile in analytics and decision making is language. Whether you have prescriptive or predictive analytics abilities, embraced Big Data, and have state-of-the-art analytics tools that process data in real time, you still need to explain your results, including the reasoning process, in a language the reader understands. No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story. In January 2017, Forbes called Natural Language Generation (NLG) one of the hottest trends of the year. Gartner has described NLG as the last-step in the Data Discovery and BI & Analytics processes. Essentially, Natural Language Generation is software that knows how to write automatically. It connects to data and Big Data tools and explains the results of the analysis in plain English or other local language. You no longer have to settle with static structured statistical analysis results reports. With NLG, executive summaries and detailed analysis reports that discuss performance can be automatically written with drill down explanations of trends and outliers. NLG solutions can be integrated with interactive dashboards where data can be selected and the descriptive insights focused on this selected data can be automatically updated.
