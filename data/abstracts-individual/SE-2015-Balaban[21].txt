Triangulation is a strategy for increasing credibility of research. It can be used to investigate the same phenomenon or system through comparison at different levels. The literature review covers state of the art of replication and comparison studies in Modeling and Simulation (MANDS). The following discussion identifies main differences between the terms triangulation, replication and scenario. Finally, different dimensions indicating possible configurations of triangulation are explored providing initial guidance on how they could improve credibility of MANDS research.
