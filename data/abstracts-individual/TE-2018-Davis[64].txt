Critical thinking is widely accepted as a requisite skill for successful military leaders. Todays defense leaders must thwart sudden assaults with preemptive parries and innovative defensive tactics. This requires a level of critical thinking and meta-cognition that is not always found in educational processes today. Effectively enhancing that skill set via a range of training techniques has a well-documented history, but the current application of those techniques remains problematical for a number of reasons. The authors' past and current research is in the use of conversational on-line agents in a number of contexts and in the use of distributed computing and simulation. They assert these can be used to address problems in critical thinking training. These capabilities tender a solution to global application and continuous availability of this training for DoD personnel. The need for critical thinking is taken as a given. A brief survey of effective critical thinking pedagogies is followed by an analysis of which would be most effectively adapted to the distributed simulation/agent environment. Then this paper discusses both the distributed computing simulation capabilities that have been demonstrated and the emerging technologies enabling the delivery of engaging conversational agents. These agents are capable of carrying on a life-like verbal exchange with the users. Examples of where and how both the distributed computing and agent interfaces have proven effective are given, with analysis about the impact these capabilities would have on critical thinking training. A discussion is presented concerning the relative benefits of using animated agents vice using video clips of live personnel as the response vehicle for the conversation. The efficacy of using an active voice recognition-enabled dialogue instead of a text delivered didactic approach is discussed. The paper closes with a description of how such a system could effectively serve DoD personnel.
