This paper discusses the development and application of an analytical assessment methodology anchored in systems engineering principles, affordance theory, and human abilities, to measure the potential of an integrated training environments (ITE) ability to effectively support training. An integrated training environment is defined as any human in-the-loop training system that includes live, virtual, constructive, or game supported training aids, devices, simulators, or simulations (TADSS) alone or in combination, that support the deliberate practice of skills for defined mission tasks. Empirical investigation of ITEs is costly, lacks formal guidance, and is therefore often unreliable. If conducted, ad hoc studies, commissioned by individual organizations, constitute the current state of Army ITE evaluation. These assessments are often entirely based on subjective opinions gained through surveys, which produce results that are at best indirectly and loosely linked to the ITEs themselves. What is required is a repeatable, inexpensive, analytical approach to ITE assessment that bounds the potential of a given system to the support it provides to the deliberate practice of specific tasks. The results of this research include the development and use of the integrated training environment assessment methodology (ITEAM). ITEAM was used to evaluate the ability of several ITEs to support the deliberate practice of specific tasks during training. During application, ITEAM consistently predicted where training was supported by an ITE and generally how well. ITEAM is offered as a tool for assessing ITE utility post fielding and as a guide for defining and verifying ITE requirements during the systems engineering development process.
