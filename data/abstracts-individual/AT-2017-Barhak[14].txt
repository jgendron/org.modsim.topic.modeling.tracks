The Reference Model for disease progression combines multiple disease models to predict clinical outcomes. Recent advances allow merging multiple models extracted from multiple populations in different times to best fit multiple cohorts reported by different clinical trials across several decades. Merging the models showed that models are getting outdated due to medical practice improvement. Introducing temporal correction to the models to account for model outdating allows creating a new model combination that improves the fitness. This suggests that future predictions of a model should include temporal correction. This is particularly true when discussing long term predictions such as life expectancy. In this paper, the life expectancy of diabetic patients is assessed categorized by 6 dimensions: age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, A1C, and Smoking. Those predictions are compared to predictions made with and without temporal correction to figure out how many life years can be saved by medical progress made during a patients lifetime.
