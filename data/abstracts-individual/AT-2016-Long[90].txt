Data analytics is the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions and is used in industry to improve organizational decision-making and in the sciences to verify or disprove existing models or theories. Current data analytic models have begun to make an impact on the way that courses are designed, run, and evaluated, although little progress has been made towards the design of a structured method to categorize and implement data measurements as they relate to the Army Learning Model (ALM) goals. The following paper describes ongoing work with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to examine data analytics as it relates to the design of courses, evaluation of individual and group performances, and the ability to tailor the learning experience to achieve optimal learning outcomes. This paper describes: a) the methodology for research and evaluation; b) the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining; c) data analytics methods and techniques relevant to learning systems; and d) a framework for applying data analytic methods and techniques for learning via three illustrative use cases. Ultimately, the goal of this paper will be to provide a vision for successful application of these techniques within the Army learning community and higher education.
