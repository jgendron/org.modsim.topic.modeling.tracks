The acquisition system is broken.It is an axiom that the acquisition system is built for an industrial-age world and has demonstrated its inability to keep up with the demands of a post-industrial world. It is taken on faith that reforming the acquisition system should focus on the acquisition workforce. Addressing the root causes of perceived ineffectiveness of the acquisition system includes many people and processes that are generally not considered in acquisition reform. The latest solution to address symptoms rather than root causes is the Cross Functional Team, which is nothing new; it is the concept of the overarching integrated product team (OIPT)  already part of acquisition doctrine  by another name. It is time to consider the entire acquisition system, leveraging modeling tools and not just program execution. This paper begins the discussion of five areas that the authors believe can improve acquisition that are not being addressed in current discussions: the requirements process, the process of selecting PMs, disincentives to innovate, the budgeting process, and use of Government-owned simulation tools.
