Traumatic life-threatening injuries often need immediate intravenous access for the delivery of fluids and medications. Although medics, nurses, and physicians are highly trained in obtaining intravenous access, when access is difficult or altogether impossible to achieve, alternative methods to accomplish fluid and medication administration are essential. Humeral head Intraosseous (IO) infusion is the process of delivering fluids directly into the marrow of the humerus to provide a non-collapsible entry point into the circulatory system. This technique is used in emergency situations to provide fluids and medication quickly when intravenous access is not available or not feasible. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) executed a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) initiative to analyze the scientific, technical, commercial merit, and feasibility of using a low-cost medical simulator for training medical personnel in Army Combat Training Schools the Humeral head IO procedure. As part of the initial phase, ARL conducted research and developed a capability to fill the gap in training this procedure. This paper will discuss how training requirements impacted the design and development of the Humeral head IO model and how subject matter expertise was utilized to identify performance metrics. Data from user evaluations exploring benefit to training, system usability (ease of use), anatomical accuracy, physiological accuracy, realism, and motivation to use will be presented.
