Within the defense sector of the modeling & simulation industry, most simulation-based training systems are comprised of a mixture of heterogeneous technologies that are highly challenging and expensive to develop, maintain and network. Some systems consist of custom-developed solutions and/or exploit open source technologies. Others rely on commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) tools. The use of closed, proprietary technologies, data and tools can have great benefit, but adds complexity, cost and risk. Even though a variety of industry standards for communication protocols and datasets exist today for various components of simulation solutions, no formalized intra-organizational system of systems approach exists for simulation solution development. As such, simulation software developers are often forced to use ad-hoc development and non-standard methods to interface technologies, especially when working with proprietary components. These ad-hoc methods increase development time and add cost and risk that could be reduced if simulation systems were developed using a common set of industry standards and methods. Where organizations like the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) are helpful, major gaps remain. This paper discusses why the gaps occur and methods that have been used to eliminate them.
