Virtual simulation lacks the variation and realism necessary to fully immerse trainees into a simulated world. As a result, trainees have a difficult time paying full attention and waste valuable training cycle time. As training budgets shift from live to virtual approaches, predictable artificial intelligence and unrealistic surroundings detract from training goals, and undermine training efficacy. To increase return on investment and better prepare soldiers, it is important to simulate a population that acts and communicates realistically. It is essential to shift away from traditional scripting approaches to adaptive techniques which can be reviewed, understood, and augmented by subject matter experts visually. This paper highlights how goal-directed, configurable, and reactive behavior templates address training gaps often ignored by existing training simulations. It details how a framework that allows for adaptive character goals creates more realistic and cost-effective, immersive experiences for trainees than scripted equivalents. With a goal-directed approach, details like how Non-Player Characters (NPCs) communicate, what NPCs recognize in the surrounding terrain, who an NPC knows, and how an NPC engages with players can contribute to the choices NPCs make. This paper explores how a cognitive architecture enables NPCs to make their own decisions throughout their day based on their role in a population and what they actually need to do. Each NPC is not hard-coded but instead observes others, perceives outcomes, reacts to changing situations, and chooses activities (e.g. working, eating) accordingly, thus adding a level of realism to training simulations that is unparalleled in traditional scripted training scenarios.
