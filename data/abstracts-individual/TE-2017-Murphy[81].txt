The design of training exercises within the U.S Army involves simulating the real-world operational environment (OE) to the greatest extent possible. The increasing availability of public information relevant to the OE represents both opportunities and challenges for training and exercise planners. In this paper we examine using open-source event data as intelligence content by providing a faceted search capability based on an OE ontology. Event data is useful for exercise design not only because it informs the OE, but because events are used to motivate training tasks when the exercise is actually conducted. The news articles used as sources for event-mining systems can contain a variety of useful references to OE elements, including enumerations of intentional acts (violence, protests, diplomacy), and actors (victims, perpetrators) in a given area, as well as intangible variables such as effects upon regional stability and the mood of the populace. Many of these parameters are parsed and coded by event mining systems such as the Global Database of Events, Languages and Tone (GDELT) and the Integrated Crises Early Warning System (ICEWS). Further, these systems use a common taxonomy for event coding. Our OE ontology allows these data sets to be searched using terms that are familiar to unit commanders by mapping the event codes to OE taxonomies and lexicons used by the Army. We apply our ontology to build a search application hosted in our OE Enterprise Repository, a data store built on the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Big Data Platform.
