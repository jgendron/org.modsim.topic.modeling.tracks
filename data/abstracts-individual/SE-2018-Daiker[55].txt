The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is conducting research into the utilization of real-time human characterization models for the prediction and mitigation of flight crew Spatial Disorientation (SD) through customized alerting solutions. Despite rapidly evolving flight deck technologies over the past fifty years, reported occurrences of flight crew SD have not decreased. Under the Technologies for Aircraft State Awareness sub-project, NASA researchers have partnered with experts in the field of flight crew SD research from academia and private industry to develop a human software model for the real-time prediction of flight crew SD. Using a combination of a human-vestibular system model, aircraft dynamics, and physiological sensors, a characterization model was developed to estimate the discrepancy between perceived aircraft state (via eye tracking and other devices) for comparison against state data from the avionics system in order to detect flight crew SD. The Cost Effective Devices for Alerting Research (CEDAR) study seeks to build upon this work using the human SD software model to trigger salient alerting solutions which have been customized to meet the current attentional demands of the flight crew. This research is intended to develop a proof-of-concept for real-time SD mitigation which could eventually be utilized to improve safety in future air transport operations. This paper will discuss the details of how the proposed system will function, including the current state of this research and directions for future work.
