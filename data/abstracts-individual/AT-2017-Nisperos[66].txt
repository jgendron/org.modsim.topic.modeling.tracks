Rising stress levels is a significant problem in the USA. The average stress levels increased to 5.1 in 2015 compared to 4.9 in 2014 (American Psychological Association, 2016). People who do not have tools to manage their stress are more likely to acquire cardiovascular disease (CVD)  the leading cause of death in the USA. In Hampton Roads, an average of 23% of Medicare beneficiaries were treated for heart disease (Greater Hampton Roads, 2014). For affected individuals, it not only implies health risks but also increased medical expenditures which can lead to financial issues  the top stressor in the USA. Therefore, interventions are needed to manage the risk of CVD. Harvard Health Publications (2009) indicates that yoga reduces the stress perceived and modulates stress response systems. Sudarshan KriyaYoga (SKY), a form of yogic breathing, is unique method for balancing the autonomic nervous system and influencing psychologic and stress related disorders (Brown & Gerbarg, 2005). An agent-based model was developed in this study to simulate the micro and macro-level impact of adopting SKY in Hampton Roads, particularly on managing stress, preventing CVD and reducing the associated medical expenses. The validation results indicate that the difference between the published results of research studies on SKY and the simulation results are not statistically significant. Simulation results show that people who practice SKY have generally lower and normal SBP, BMI and stress level while those who dont, have generally higher and falls on the high-risk category. The analysis of variance suggests that the increase in SKY population in Hampton Roads provides an extremely significant effect in decreasing the percentage of CVD high risk population, associated expenses and the overall stress level in the region. In addition, advertising SKY offers greater impact on improving the risk factors and reducing the expenses associated to CVD in Hampton Roads.
