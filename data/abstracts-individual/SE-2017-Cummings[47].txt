Warfare is no longer primarily a function of capital, labor and technology superiority on the battlefield. Rather, warfare has expanded to complex interconnected networks of information that can shape the outcome of conflict, on and off the battlefield. In the case of hearts and minds warfare, the Internet and social media has been used to share and often spread information in order to produce negative propaganda towards the conflicting parties. (Berman, Shapiro and Felter (2011) Using modern and highly prevalent methods of interaction, terrorist organizations continuously expand their networks through real-time information exchange, enabling operatives to organize, spread information (and misinformation), and recruit new members into their terrorist organizations. As Taspinar (2009) states within his policy publication Fighting Radicalism, there are no terrorist societies only conditions for the emergence of terrorist activities. The relative popularity of certain terrorist networks can only be explained within the framework of such radicalized societies where extremist violence finds a climate of legitimacy and implicit support. Such radicalized societies are permeated by a deep sense of collective frustration, humiliation, and deprivation relative to expectations. Terrorists easily exploit this radicalized social habitat.
