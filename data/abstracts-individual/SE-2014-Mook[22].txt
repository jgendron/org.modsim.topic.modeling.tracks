Typically, commercially available modeling and simulation products are tools that allow Modeling and Simulation (MANDS) practitioners to construct, run, and analyze simulations. These products are useful only to professionals in the MANDS field who know how to properly construct a model and generate the required analysis. This necessitates the use of commercial products in conjunction with a professional to sell modeling and simulation as a service. In certain situations, customers may not want to purchase a service, but a tool that they can use themselves. This paper presents an approach to MANDS which results in a standalone tool. The tool in this example was developed specifically for use in a manufacturing setting, not by the MANDS professional, but by the people in charge of planning and executing the work. By shaping the inputs and the analysis to align with the customers knowledge base, a non- MANDS user can complete simulations with little or no assistance from the experts that developed the model.
