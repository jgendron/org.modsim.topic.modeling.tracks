In this paper we present visualizations that decipher the hidden rules or logic of complex traffic patterns that help analysts understand and improve operations. We demonstrate this technology on aircraft carriers using simulated notional data from hundreds of simulations and plotting their statistical variations. Operations on aircraft carriers are often described as controlled but complex. Complex organizational systems, such as those that govern and effect aircraft movement onboard carriers, do not operate on predetermined low level rules but rather adapt and learn based on high-level guidelines. Critical situations that are often new or unique are best tackled by adaptive and well-trained organizations. One approach to building a scalable and adaptable organization is to use simulation based training. This approach enables familiarizing stakeholders with repetitive patterns of behaviors and also exploring what if scenarios never before attempted. We present typical examples of data statistics, visual analytics, and rule and pattern analysis from carrier deck notional data. These techniques help analysts explore the data and its patterns to improve operational processes. These tools could also support Validation and Verification (V&V) of the rules engine of the simulator. The algorithms and logic developed in this paper are scalable across domains. The methodology, algorithms and tools have a number of potential customers in the Navy community, the broader Department of Defense community and the commercial sector. This technology will scale to manage the traffic pattern of any asset moving in groups subject to complex spatio-temporal constraints. Some of the possible application domains are depot maintenance, a manufacturing shop floor, airport traffic management and even theme parks where people move in groups.
