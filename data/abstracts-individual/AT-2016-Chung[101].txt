     An Integrated Gate Turnaround Management (IGTM) prototype was developed at NASA Ames Simulation Laboratories (SimLabs) using Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) to demonstrate the IGTM concepts feasibility and benefits in improving the traffic performance during the turnaround at the gate over uncertainties from flight activities and available resources. The simulation architecture includes: the IGTM controller, an Airline Operations Control (AOC) application, Big Data/Analytics Input (BAI) application, a terminal traffic simulation or known as NASA-developed Surface Operation Simulator and Scheduler (SOSS), and a Database Server. ActiveMQ, a Java messaging service, was used to emulate the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) data network messaging. This paper describes the modeling and simulation of the IGTM concept, and illustrates selected use cases to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the IGTM concept for optimizing gate turnaround operations.
