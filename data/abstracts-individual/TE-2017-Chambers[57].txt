The Joint Staff (JS) J7 is developing Joint Training Tools as modular simulation services to reside within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE). The JTSE will be a web-enabled, enterprise environment that provides scalable, modular simulation services on-demand, and operationally relevant training. Terrain data and geospatial planning are important components of these environments for scenario development. Commercial online data sources, such as Google Earth, can be used during scenario planning and development. However, paper maps and/or PowerPoint generated slides are more often used during planning conferences to determine how geography will affect the training event or to identify key terrain features, avenues of approach, Lines of Communications (LOC), objective areas, and other mission needs. During the scenario development process, Modeling and Simulation (MANDS) planners provide terrain database developers with the initial simulation datasets requirement terrain builds. Specific details, such as the need for high fidelity imagery or 3D models are typically communicated later in the scenario development process. These details often come after MANDS planners have viewed the initial terrain database. Communication between the MANDS planners and the terrain data builders is extremely important because artifacts created during the scenario planning conferences are not always shared with the terrain database developers. This paper describes how the web-based Terrain Generation Service (TGS), developed as a part of the JTSE Joint Training tools, could support scenario development, and improve communication between an event planner and the terrain database development team by leveraging existing web-based global MANDS terrain repositories and geospatial data standards.
