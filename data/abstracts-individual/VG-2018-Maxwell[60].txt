Low cost virtual reality systems are currently available to consumers at a quality and price point never before offered. The military training community has begun to investigate these devices given the potential for immersive training. While these systems may be acceptable for training many tasks, their budget-focused quality introduces visual impairments that compromise performance on some critical tasks. We will demonstrate how users with normal vision may be limited to lower visual acuity within virtual environments due to the limitations of the VR device. Given the specific visual acuity needs of military training applications, this paper calls for caution when using low cost HMDs for AR/VR based training. This paper discusses how the quality of current virtual reality components affects critical training tasks and we mathematically demonstrate the issues with the typical COTS VR offerings. We discuss a strategy for determining if a specific training need is applicable for the VR systems by showing the calculations needed to pair the training requirements to the hardware specifications of the equipment. Lastly, we will discuss a use case that directly relates to the topic that requires a mounted soldier to identify signs of improvised explosive devices at distance. It is Aptimas intent to leave the reader with the knowledge needed to properly evaluate the training activity and pair it to the technical attributes and hardware specifications of the candidate virtual reality apparatus.
