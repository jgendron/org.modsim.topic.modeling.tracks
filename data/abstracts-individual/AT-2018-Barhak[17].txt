Abundance of information is collected in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during patient stay. To help humans cope with abundance of such data, computers can help with 1) pre-processing and 2) visualization. Fortunately modern languages such as Python provide good tools to help programmers aid in those tasks. Tools such as Pandas allow import of data into a standard dataframe that can be processed with machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and later this data can be visualized interactively in web environment using Bokeh. The Jupyter notebook interface allows quick prototyping of the methods. This work shows how this collection of tools can be used to visualize patient data and filter it for outliers using multiple machine learning algorithms. The prototype created in this work is applied on a public ICU dataset with the intention of future extension towards automated detection of outliers in the data. Such outliers can either indicate hazards or should be removed before further analysis. Open source code and visualization are publicly available to support this paper.
