Simulation-Based Training (SBT) provides safe settings for training tasks that otherwise are too challenging or risky in live training counterparts. SBT also affords the development of controlled environments for user acclimation with emerging technologies, such as Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS). The military emerging technologies literature demands an increase in robot-aided Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) for the detection of High Value Individuals (HVI) and identifies SBT as a required medium for UGS operator training. Robot-aided ISR is a predominantly perceptual task. Prior experimentation suggests that Highlighting and Massed Exposure instructional strategies enhance perceptual skills training by reducing trainees response time for overall behavior cue analysis a critical skill for HVI identification. The objective of this experiment was to assess the impact of these strategies on detection accuracy and speed for each cue type which indicate nervous or aggressive behavior. Results suggest that Massed Exposure improves response time for detecting nervous human behavior cues.
