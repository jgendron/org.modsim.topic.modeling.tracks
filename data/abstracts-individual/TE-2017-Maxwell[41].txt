The United States Army has a significant investment dedicated to the use of virtual environments for infantry soldier skills training. Although there is a pervasive attitude within the acquisition community that a training systems graphics quality is the strongest indicator of training quality and utility. A literature review of performance assessment of infantry soldiers who have been trained using simulation-based training technology reveals very little data exists to quantify the return on this investment and validate this assumption. Further, the Government Accounting Office in 2013 and 2016 calls for better assessment of costs and training performance to properly assess the systems. Beginning in 2014, researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the University of Central Florida designed and executed a large-scale study that collected performance data from over 50 squads of dismounted infantry soldiers. Multiple training treatments were provided to the squads, including a baseline treatment where they were provided only traditional live training, only virtual, and a treatment that combines live and virtual. This paper will discuss a comparison of the mental effort of soldiers trained with virtual means to soldiers trained with traditional live means. Further, the analysis will include the Situational Training Exercise (STX) performance assessments of the soldiers to attempt to determine if there are any correlations between the differences in the mental effort of the training treatments.
