A decade ago, it was assumed that simulation based training applications such as VBS3 (Virtual Battle Spaces 3) that use commercially available game engines would become a ubiquitous part of the infantry soldiers training curriculum. Unfortunately, the virtual environments for soldier training have encountered significant barriers to adoption as the underlying COTS technologies were not designed to conform to DoD information assurance policy. Most government employees and military service members are not privileged users with elevated security access to their computing equipment and cannot install the software. Further, depending on the network they are connected to, the software may not have the requisite Certificates of Net-worthiness or an Authority to Operate and cannot be installed. To use these technologies, classrooms at training sites with stand-alone networks must be specially prepared. This paper will discuss the common technical barriers preventing COTS game engines from gaining wide DoD installation approvals. This paper will also discuss a prototype virtual world simulation that has been developed at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory that leverages HTML5 and WebGL technology to create a simulation based virtual environment simulation that can be accessed via a common web browser. This prototype needs no third-party client software to be installed and should allow for military connected to the Internet to access training material. We will discuss the security implications for this approach, content protection, digital certificates for identity management, and the need to keep the simulator software and the training content separate.
