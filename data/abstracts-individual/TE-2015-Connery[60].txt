Averaging Virtualization Technology for Command and Control Systems Training      C2 System Training Challenges for NORAD and USNORTHCOM Missions  Unique C2 systems and simulation models  Expensive scenario development  Isolated internal system simulations  Single mission stimulus  Limited participants  Crews memorized the limited set of scenarios  Resulted in negative training NORAD Bi-National mission: To conduct aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in the defense of North America. USNORTHCOM mission: Partner to conduct homeland defense, civil support, and security cooperation to defend and secure the United States and its interests.  2   NORAD and USNORTHCOM Training C2 System Objectives Dynamic scenario injection Utilize Services JLVC toolkit Stimulate multiple C2 systems Synchronized multi-mission Cross-domain guards                 Local training or multi-echelon Affordable for Alternate and Trainer     Initial Focus: Air Warning Training  Original work plan was revectored  Leadership changed prioritization of primary C2 system to a new Remote Tactical Air Picture (RTAP)  No documentation; not feasible to emulate  Command introduced a new Air Event Information Sharing Service (A/EISS)  Stopped adaptation work on existing Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) to directly stimulate the old primary system, Air Mission Evolution (AME)  Way-ahead  Virtualized training system  Rather than emulating individual feeds into four local C2 systems, stepped back one level to common source, Battle Control System (BCS)  Virtualization of BCS and our C2 systems provided cost-effective replication with authentic processing, messages, and displays  End result is an end-to-end air string representing inputs from military, FAA, and NAVCAN sensors through the NORAD sectors BCS processing with outputs merged into Headquarters systems  4   Air Warning C2 System Training  AWSIM modified to model North America AOR (primarily FAA civilian aviation)  AWSIM Model Operator dynamically stimulating virtualized BCS  Authentic BCS processing with outputs to virtualized NORAD C2 systems  Warfighter trains at operational workstation  added thin client hardware  Adding a historic event capture and replay capability       A/EISS  A/EISS      AME  AME  Virtualized Virtualized    GCCS  GCCS   RTAP RTAP BCS BCS Historic Event Replay/Injector Historic Event Replay/Injector    5                       Virtualization Benefits View of training systems have same Look/Touch/Feel as operational systems Authentic processing and message content Inherits many Cyber Security and Information Assurance characteristics  simplified approval for Authority to Operate Virtual machines are files  Small footprint  AWSIM, four NORAD Sectors BCS components and HQ C2 systems hosted on two virtualization servers  Easily restored back to initial state  Select files for software upgrades, mixing versions or reverting back Cost-effective  Replicated for Qualification Trainer, Alternate Operations Center and Cyber Range   6   Virtual Air WarningTraining Systems vCenter Map View    Air Defense Sector Components (one of four - WADS) AWSIM                    Headquarters C2 Systems GCCS/Agile Client A/EISS and RTAP  7   Air Warning C2 Training System Deployment  Server Rooms AWSIM Model Operator Trainee Positions  8   Next: Virtualized/Distributed/Integrated Air and Missile Event C2 System Training   9   Summary Leveraged virtualization technology to enhance NORAD and USNORTHCOM C2 system training objectives       Dynamic scenario injection Utilizes Services JLVC toolkit - AWSIM Stimulates multiple C2 systems with authentic processing, messages, and displays Initially deployed for local training, but scalable for distributed multi-echelon events Affordably replicated in Alternate Command Center and Qualification Trainer Expanding capabilities for synchronized air and missile event multi-mission training
