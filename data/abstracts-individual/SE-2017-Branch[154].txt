The Old Dominion University Modeling and Simulation senior design class is developing a system to rapidly model prototypes of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). The system is a component of a larger system the Naval Sea System Command plans to use to develop test strategies for autonomous USVs. The purpose of this paper is to describe the high-level design of the system. The Rapid USV Model Prototyping System (RUMPS) consists of three components: a motion model which is a mathematical representation of the motion of a USV, a tool that aids in the creation of the parameters for the USV motion model, and a visualization of the trajectory of the USVs motion and performance metrics. Additionally, software packages and dynamics engines that may be applicable to the integration of a USV motion model. The system will be verified to ensure proper integration of the system components. The system will also be validated by comparing the motion models behavior to that of an actual boat representative to a USV. This paper also describes how each component in the system works, identifies relevant software applicable to the implementation of a USV model, and describe the process to conduct validation.
