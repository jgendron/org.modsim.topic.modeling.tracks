Each year, the Joint Staff J7 (Joint Training) organizes numerous large-scale joint and coalition training events. These challenging, fast-paced exercises include a wide range of training objectives that must be accomplished on an intense schedule and (particularly of late) on a constricted budget. Military leaders, therefore, are continuously searching for ways to enrich the events training outcomes without inflating their costs. Over the last three years, the Joint Staff J7, Deputy Director for Joint Training has developed, tested, and deployed a Blended LearningTraining System to enhance joint training and efficiently help identify and fill knowledge gaps across the joint training continuum. The system provides Combatant Commands and Joint Force Commands with options to maximize their training by blending online learning activities, metrics and assessments, and in-resident academics and table top exercises, that also includes distributed small-group simulation-based part-task trainers, and tailored feedback mechanisms that are all built into the Joint Event Life Cycle. This paper briefly reviews the development process and current status of the Blended LearningTraining System, and then it discusses two future joint training enhancements that the system now facilitates: (1) multi-lifecycle planning to integrate training events and (2) increased support for Mission Command within joint training.
