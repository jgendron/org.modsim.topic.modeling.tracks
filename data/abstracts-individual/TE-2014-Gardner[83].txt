The Air Force Medical Modeling and Simulation Training (AFMMAST) program within the Air Education and Training Command of the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) delivers medical simulation training to thousands of medical personnel each year at over 80 sites around the globe. The programs rapid expansion began in 2007, and it continues to grow, allowing more individuals and teams to be trained on critical medical skills. With this expansion and given the distributed nature of the program, AFMMAST simulation operators and personnel at each site have been able to develop simulation training scenarios and curriculum to meet the needs of the medical professionals at their sites and in their Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Although AFMMAST personnel have been able to meet site-specific training needs and develop tailored, on-demand training, the programs rapid expansion has led to a lack of standardization in how simulation equipment is used; training needs are analyzed; and curriculum/training scenarios designed, developed, and implemented to support identified, site-specific training needs. Research has shown that standardization of curriculum that uses simulation has been shown to improve skill acquisition and retention as well as reduce complications in the performance of the simulator-trained skill in practice. For that reason, the AFMMAST Central Program Office (CPO), which provides oversight and leadership over the AMMAST program, launched an initiative along with ICF International to help standardize the training delivered by the simulation operators and personnel at each site, allowing them to be flexible and responsive to their sites needs while also ensuring the instructional integrity of the training produced and the functionality of the equipment used.
