Augmenting Model-Based Design with the HEAT Human System Integration Advisor While automated design methods based on model-driven design have produced enormous strides in efficiency and reduced lifecycle costs, human factors experts have traditionally performed separate but complementary analysis not accommodated by modeling tools. This paper describes a major effort funded by the U.S. Marine Corps to integrate human modeling into model-driven design. Example applications are to analyze the crew space in a vehicle, aircraft, tank, etc. for issues ranging from ability to accommodate individuals in a range of sizes, account for gear worn by warfighters, examine both static position and dynamic movement of human occupants, and identify safety issues. We describe the Human Systems Integration (HSI) Engineering Analysis Tool, or HEAT. HEAT provides advice for engineers using material-design software on how their design choices affect HSI domains. While there are eight HSI domainsEnvironment, Habitability, Human Factors Engineering (HFE), Manpower, Personnel, Safety, Survivability, and Training that HEATs design can accommodate, we discuss here our recent work on Human Factors Engineering, Survivability/Safety, and Habitability. HEAT is designed in a modular fashion to integrate with the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) Framework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT). We present a scenario of use for HEAT illustrating the derivation of potential HSI risks for a crew space, and the use of HEAT to monitor and detect changes in the engineering model that are made to address another concern (corrosion), but inadvertently have an HSI impact.
