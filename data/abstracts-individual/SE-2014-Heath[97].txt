SUMMIT is a Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate-sponsored software environment for connecting simulation tools that enable the emergency preparedness community to more effectively and economically prepare for and respond to real and potential incidents. SUMMIT allows users to dynamically link, configure and execute a library of models and data sources. All integrated model configuration and result displays cannot be developed a priori as the library of data types and available models continues to expand and because SUMMITs users have different visualization requirements (desktop applications, mobile clients, virtual worlds). We present a data type-centered methodology, and its use in national and regional level exercises, to meet the above challenges. Using a configurable system of data representations, SUMMIT is able to dynamically generate visual representations for data based on the interfaces of the linked models. This approach allows users to make use of disparate modeling capabilities across a variety of tools in unanticipated ways while maintaining a consolidated user interface.
