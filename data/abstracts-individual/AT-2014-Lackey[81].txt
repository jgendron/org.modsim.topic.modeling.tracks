Translating results from laboratory-based research studies conducted with novice participants (e.g. university students) to real-world applications represents a critical challenge facing researchers. Risk mitigation cannot wait until data is collected and analyzed, rather it must permeate every phase of the research process. Empirical evidence suggests that prudent application of fundamental human factors and training principles support experimental findings that equate to relevant recommendations for expert populations regardless of sample population experience. This paper presents five compelling strategies for conducting human participant research using novice populations that facilitate empirically sound insights for expert operators. Specifically, (1) designing experiments, (2) distilling skills into core components, (3) scaffolding, (4) proficiency testing, and (5) interpreting results will be discussed. The methods described represent the best practices in ongoing research efforts impacting highly specialized expert populations: Warfighters and nuclear power plant operators. The recommendations provided illustrate the potential that interdisciplinary experimental methods offer quantitative researchers.
