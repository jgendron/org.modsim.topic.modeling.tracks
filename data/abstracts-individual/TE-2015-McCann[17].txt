This paper explores the literature regarding the development of higher order learning through student participation in technology enhanced environments, specifically, the use of mobile devices in the practice of critical thinking by leveraging inherent elements and affordances of temporality, space, and connectedness that mobile devices provide. The literature on mobile learning only recently began to explore critical thinking and remains focused on content delivery. However, the collaboration, just-in-time, and learning-on-the-go capabilities of mobile learning hold potential for deeper discourse within the context of higher order learning. This paper argues that carefully designed learning spaces, accessible by technology in hand, create beneficial opportunities for reflection and critical thinking that drive academia, business, and military organizations. However, poor definitions of critical thinking compromise its effective development and evaluation. Through an inquiry of higher order learning, critical thinking, mobile learning, and technology enhanced learning, the author defines and recognizes reflection as an essential component of critical thinking, identifies gaps in research associated with higher order mobile learning, and establishes the importance of critical thinking in mobile learning.
