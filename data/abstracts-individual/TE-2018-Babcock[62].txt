The purpose of this paper is to report how the implementation of a targeted micro-training program, based on monthly error trend reports, has resulted in significant reduction in performance errors. This training solution, designed to focus on specific performance errors, is based on the principles of micro-training and performance diagnostics as a methodology for addressing performance issues. This paper discusses how this new training program was designed using innovative concepts and implemented to meet a fast-paced, 30-day deployment and implementation schedule. The paper also discusses results metrics that provide evidence of the effectiveness of the training intervention in accordance to the Kirkpatrick Model of Evaluation. The results of the study demonstrates that the program positively impacted performance improvement for both the employee and the organization as a whole.
