Medical imaging techniques play an important role in the diagnostic process. Through these techniques, it is possible to observe and analyze hidden details of the human anatomy, which is critical to the success of surgeries or clinical treatments. In so doing, an extensive experience in analyzing digital medical images is requested. However, physicians do not currently master such expertise. Therefore, greater accuracy and improved technology in dealing with these images must be sought. In particular, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, about 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year, which equates to 1 in every 4 deaths. Thus, computational tools for dealing with this grim reality are also imperative. In this context, emerging technologies such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Holography are increasing rapidly. These technologies allow for 1) the creation of high-definition virtual computing models of human organs and 2) the direct manipulation of interacting interfaces through such 3D models within a holographic environment that blends virtual and real elements seamlessly. This work combines several imaging techniques to support the automated generation of Holographic 3D volumetric heart models from coronary tomography. In turn, these models are presented in a real time shared holographic experience using Microsofts HoloLens, without the need of any further editing of the generated model. As a result, a tangible collaborative medical diagnostic solution, using shared reality concepts with other MR devices, such as HTCs Vive, is provided.
