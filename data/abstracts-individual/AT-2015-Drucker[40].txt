Constructing and overhauling Navy aircraft carriers and submarines is among the most complex work undertaken anywhere in the world. An integral part of these operations is efficient material storage logistics. One of the largest challenges in developing logistical plans for material storage in this environment is the evolving nature of material needs; as ships are built the type of material they require to progress dramatically changes. In this paper, we introduce a simulation model which supports adaptive planning of material storage strategies. This tool utilizes discrete event simulation to adaptively plan warehouse storage layouts and parts turnover across the life of ship construction and overhaul. This tool allows NNS to accurately simulate the massive quantities of parts that arrive at the shipyard every month, route the parts based on optimal paths, and develop efficient storage strategies which are capable of growing and shrinking with program demand.
