This study examined illegal fishing activity by Foreign Fishing Vessels (FFVs), which occurs to an unknown degree and with an unknown frequency. A discrete event simulation, coded in VBA within Excel for ease of use and distribution, was used to model FFV movements and behavior, Coast Guard presence, and probability of detection to estimate the likelihood of FFV discovery. Since system arrivals are a primary output in this case, instead of the standard input, we linked this likelihood of discovery through historically documented performance to estimate the number of system arrivals, or incursions, in a given year. Model data was derived from historical mission analysis, subject matter expertise, and recent academic studies. The resulting analysis regarding the extent of FFV incursions and the overall impact of this activity on both the fish population and the U.S. and foreign economies provided the first rigorous, quantitative estimates on the extent of this problem.
