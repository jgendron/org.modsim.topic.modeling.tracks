Testing, evaluation, training, and characterization of large, complex information systems is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Sandia National Laboratories has pursued research over the last 10 years to develop tools and technologies to help address these issues. Enter EmulyticsTM. The goals of this paper are to: (1) describe EmulyticsTM (emulation + analytics); (2) bring awareness to some of the current research efforts at Sandia and how they have been employed for a variety projects; and (3) share some lessons learned and success stories. The discussion of EmulyticsTM research begins by outlining the methodology for successfully creating models of large, complex systems using a variety of techniques. These systems include the blending of simulation, virtualization of hardware and software, emulation of devices, and direct deployment of actual hardware and software  that is, live-virtual-constructive (i.e., real-emulated-simulated) environments. Next, the discussion covers the building blocks used to create immersive, high-fidelity, system emulation environments to perform testing in areas such as: test and evaluation of security architectures and security devices; personnel training; course of action (COA) analysis; and application performance. Finally, we discuss some of the current research efforts, deployments and challenges.
