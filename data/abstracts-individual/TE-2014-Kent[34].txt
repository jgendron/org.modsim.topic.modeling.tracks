Battlefield complexity has increased dramatically in recent years. Simulation of large scale maneuvering and troop engagement such as those which occur in military action requires the interaction of large numbers of troops with a wide variety of friendly, neutral, and enemy roles. In order to fully prepare units for combat, considerable effort needs to be expended to set up realistic battle scenarios and engage in simulated combat exercises. This paper describes planning, preparation, and setup required for a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) simulation scenarios such as those conducted at the United States Armys Combat Training Centers (CTCs) at Fort Irwin California, Fort Polk, Louisiana, and Hohenfels, Germany. The setup includes planning for the unit in training, planning for exercise setup, and planning for the simulation tools required to produce a truly realistic learning situation.
