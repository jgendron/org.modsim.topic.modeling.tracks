The majority of incoming Marines are digital natives who learn and thrive with technology outside of The Basic School (TBS), but are hindered while attending TBS. The Land Navigation App will augment the classroom and practical application part of TBSs Land Navigation Course by providing its students with the opportunity to practice land navigation skills by identifying terrain features, working on a map, determining azimuth, and identifying compass parts. Students will also have access to the course material for reference to help them prepare for training events before and after the classroom instruction. This application allows the students to use their issued map, see different areas of the base exactly as they look in the world, and work with their compass. This allows students to make mistakes without being judged by their peers or instructors. This mobile application gives them the chance to practice their skills, both written and kinematic, while learning the vital elements of land navigation. The mobile app will propel TBS into the classroom of the future by closing part of the mobile learning capability gap. With this application TBS can begin to integrate mobile learning into their curriculum, fundamentally altering the previous instructional model by rapidly reducing the required classroom time and the number of instructors while improving the capabilities of the students and staff. Furthermore, mobile learning could make test taking secure and provide rapid in-hand feedback to students and instructors, ultimately reducing the amount of time required to train new officers.
