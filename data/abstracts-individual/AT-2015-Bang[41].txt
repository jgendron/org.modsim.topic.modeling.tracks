For high fidelity, Interoperation of heterogeneous levels of models could be suggested as one of the reasonable methodologies in defense modeling and simulation. Engagement-level model can be supported by engineering-level models representing the detailed functionality of its composites to increase the accuracy of Measures of Effectiveness (MOE). This paper presents a case study of anti-surface warfare (ASuW) simulation from the perspective of submarine to analyze MOE of Bearing-only Target Motion Analysis via heterogeneous models. Tactical decisions are built as engagement-level based on DEVS formalism and few physical behaviors of participants that have significant impact on the result such as maneuvering of submarine are built as engineering- level. By variant of tactics, thousands of experiments are conducted. Decision maker can select one among tactics that leads to high effectiveness. This case study shows that interoperation of heterogeneous models can serve as a sophisticated approach for evaluation of tactics with high fidelity.
