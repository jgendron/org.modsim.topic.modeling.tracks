Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS) is the sole builder of Navy aircraft carriers in the United States. Constructing and overhauling Navy aircraft carriers is among the most complex work undertaken anywhere in the world. An integral part of these operations is efficient material logistics. Utilization of material laydown and construction areas during the creation and outfitting of new carriers presents a unique challenge for both material logistics personnel and trades workers. As the ship construction process progresses, multiple factors limit the workers ability to maintain the planned schedule of work packages and jobs. Due to the shifting nature of what work is available on any given day, material logistics personnel are constantly asked to update their plans to deliver and store materials onsite. The creation of a tool to help both the trade workers and the material logistics team visualize how shifting work plans impact material laydown strategies. This will reduce touch times and eliminate lost, damaged or underutilized materials. The carrier construction material logistics tool will allow NNS to model the process of creation and outfitting through placement in the dry dock, to demonstrate the feasibility of such a model and demonstrate its benefits. Following successful creation of the initial model, users will be able to see into digital work-packages allowing them to re-plan on the fly and evaluate how these new plans will impact material flow. Users will also be able to determine if material availability, or lack thereof, will require alteration to the work- package construction sequence.
