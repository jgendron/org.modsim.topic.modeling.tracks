The AN/ARC-231 Multi-mode Airborne Radio Set (MARS) is an Airborne VHF/UHF/LOS and DAMA SATCOM communications system that supports Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for airborne, multi-band, multi- mission, secure anti-jam voice, data and imagery transmission. This system has become the de-facto communications system for aviation units throughout the DoD and among many of our international allies. The vast capability of this radio, while meeting the communications requirements of military aviators, also makes the radio very complicated to use - the users manual is over 794 pages. These issues drove the requirement to provide interactive and engaging training across a wide variety of training types and aircraft platforms. The purpose of this paper is to describe the strategy implemented in the development of the ARC-231 Multi-band Radio Simulation to support multiple types of simulation utilizing a core simulation wrapped with application interfaces to accommodate different training types, user requirements, and aircraft platforms. This paper will address the market need observed in 2009 for the implementation of a high fidelity simulation of the ARC-231 radio, the approach taken to design the core simulation, and the various types of the simulation that have been implemented as a result of the open architecture approach that was implemented from the beginning of the program. This paper is being presented to share the innovative idea behind the implementation of the ARC-231 Radio Model, the subsequent savings in terms of cost and time afforded to our customers through this approach, and lessons learned throughout the implementation and fielding process. The use of this approach has allowed the development of multiple types of trainers for a variety of customers utilizing the same core simulation. As customers find and report issues with the core model, all customers have the opportunity to benefit from the collective testing by receiving updates to their core simulation model.
