The U.S. Army continues to develop new and effective ways to use simulation for training. One example is the Non- Rated Crew Member Manned Module (NCM3), a simulator designed to train helicopter crewmembers in critical, high risk tasks. The goal of this first study was to evaluate visual modalities' effect on performance in mixed reality aerial door gunnery. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two visual modality treatments (flat screen or Head-Mounted Display) and executed three aerial door gunnery training scenarios in the NCM3. Independent variables were visual modality, immersive tendency and simulator sickness questionnaire scores. Dependent variables included performance, presence and simulator sickness change scores. The results of the study indicate no main effect of visual modality on performance. Both visual treatment groups experienced the same degree of presence and simulator sickness. Results of this study may challenge the commonly held notion that higher immersive simulation leads to better performance and presence. For this initial study, participants were drawn from an expert population of qualified non-rated crew members. Subsequent studies will examine visual modalities' effect on performance in mixed reality aerial door gunnery utilizing novice participants.
