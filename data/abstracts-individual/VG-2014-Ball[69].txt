Simulation is not the only thing to have benefited from the rapid advancement of computers over the last few decades; animated graphics have been transformed from simple square blocks on the screen to near life-like renditions of system of interest. Simulation developers have taken advantage of this new technology to graphically display their simulation results to decision-maker and potential customers alike. However, the focus of simulation developers has been on implementing the latest visualization approaches (the "hows") as opposed to determining the best way to express their results (the "whys"). This paper discusses some of the issues of the simulation visualization and their potential impact on the simulation community; this includes charlatanism and the rise of "chart junk." The paper concludes with a discussion on some of potential solutions.
