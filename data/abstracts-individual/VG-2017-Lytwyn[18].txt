The approaches of United States (US) competitors to deterrence and crisis management are evolving and have the potential to be highly escalatory. At the same time, advanced technologies are likely to increase the speed and unpredictability of future conflicts. Modeling and simulation capabilities can provide many potential outcomes to a Blue versus Red scenario using a large data set, but can only model escalatory dynamics using a pre-loaded set of response options. Alternatively, analytic gaming provides a forum where human players respond to a scenario based on their expert knowledge; they develop creative options to advance their nations interests during a crisis, bounded only by their understanding of foreign military doctrine and capabilities. This approach can reveal circumstances in which crises may have the most potential to escalate, providing indications and warning to analysts. This paper will address how analytic gaming can be applied to better understand the effects of military doctrine and advanced technologies on crisis escalation; how game design and adjudication techniques ensure that crises intensify based on player inputs and avoid unfair judgments about the reasons for escalation; and how analytic gaming reveals new insights at each step of a scenario, thereby isolating variables for future analysis. It will also discuss a path toward constructing a complementary model of an escalation scenario, informed by analytic game results.
