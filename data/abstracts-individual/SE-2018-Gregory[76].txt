Structural health monitoring (SHM) has the capacity to reduce failure by detecting damage during service life, by periodic, automated monitoring. Guided Wave (GW) Ultrasound is a common SHM approach for aerospace structures. Modelling the physics of GW SHM systems provides a route for understanding system dependencies, capabilities and limitations as damage evolves during service life. Such a toolset can strengthen the understanding of the connection between GW SHM results and the true material state. The most useful modelling tools are those that provide versatile solutions with respect to the simulated component geometry and computational grid connectivity. This work details a versatile application programming interface (API) for the elastodynamic finite integration technique for modelling GW SHM of metals. The custom code implementation, EFIT-CompCell, allows for the modelling of diverse geometries by automatically balancing the message passing interface parallelization layout. The user provides the basic parameters of the simulation and the software automatically performs an initial balancing based on anticipated computational loads, and establishes the CPU communication patterns for any geometry. This work describes the programming philosophy and code structure used to create EFIT-CompCell and compares its performance and capacity to simulation tools that are more specialized for specific architectures. Results are presented for a simulation of GW SHM of an aluminum fuselage section being tested by the FAA. The simulation consists of 733M voxels which took approximately 70 hours to complete 25000 time steps using 40 Intel Xeon E5-4650v2 Ivy Bridge processor cores.
