Psychomotor skills are foundational to numerous competencies composing the U.S. Armys vision for 21st Century Soldier Competencies as expressed in the Army Learning Model (ALM). Training these kinds of skills is being addressed in part through the use of sophisticated intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that tailor and adapt instruction during individual learning interactions. While ITS are an effective approach to training psychomotor skills, developing these systems remains a costly and time-consuming enterprise, despite the emergence of ITS authoring tools which remain limited in scope, capability, and generalizability across Army-relevant domains. We report on development of AI-supported authoring for militarily-relevant psychomotor tasks based on a fielded trainer in a psychomotor domain (marksmanship). We will present our approach to ITS authoring with an AI agent that encapsulates knowledge useful in guiding the authoring process, to include pedagogical knowledge tailored to instruction and assessment of psychomotor skills. Utilizing the Generalized Instructional Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) and its tools and methods for supporting and streamlining ITS development, we discuss how a more specialized ITS authoring tool can embed the authoring process in a dialogue between automated tool and training author. In this paper we present our findings that characterize distinctive elements of the psychomotor domain, including specific competencies and how they are learned and assessed, factors that tutoring systems in this domain of learning must accommodate. By focusing on a specific category of skill performance and not on a specific metaphor for instruction, we will illustrate how authoring tools can support development of simulation-based psychomotor skills training.
