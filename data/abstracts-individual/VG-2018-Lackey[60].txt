In industries such as manufacturing, engineering, and telecommunications, product line management professionals rely on data to inform day-to-day operational decisions and forecast planning. Within the military training community, training device product line managers aim to increase device utilization, account for Quality of Service (QoS) and realize cost avoidance goals. Data sources related to the operation and maintenance of military training devices typically involve life cycle factors such as device utilization rates, preventative and corrective maintenance records, location, and other device specific information. These data hold the key to understanding the driving forces behind critical life cycle metrics (e.g., utilization, QoS, cost). However, clearly delineating relationships based upon traditional data reporting practices is not necessarily obvious. The purpose of this paper is to present lessons learned from a multi-year effort to improve data visualization and presentation in an effort to relieve product line managers from cumbersome data reduction efforts. Using life cycle data collected on the Warfighter FOCUS contract, the authors present four graphical display methods that have significantly improved the communication between product line managers and support contractors, informed trade- off analyses, and contributed to the advancement of life cycle reporting for the military training community. The authors present practical advice for visualizing data that empowers product line managers to make data driven decisions and report status to stakeholders.
