Combat training centers run large scale training exercises simulating force on force combat. These centers use a variety of simulation equipment to monitor and control the training exercises. Maintenance and upgrade of the equipment requires both time and money. Different pieces of equipment contribute to the training exercises in distinctive ways. Often training centers encounter time sensitive tasks and limited funding related to simulation equipment maintenance and upgrades. It is important to invest in the equipment which will provide the greatest advantage for training capabilities. Enterprise Architecture (EA) tools have been used to show the relationships between technology and the business capabilities enabled by the technology. The reader will learn results of an investigation into the use of an EA tool to show the relationship between technology in use at a combat training center and the training capabilities available from that technology. The investigation focused on how technology obsolescence impacted training capabilities. In conducting this study, the importance of software upgrades and advancements became apparent. Software often has a shorter life cycle than hardware, but provides an easier upgrade and replacement plan. So system managers benefit from a different view of software obsolescence planning. Through the increased use of virtualization, a single hardware component may run large numbers of software components. The architecture tools provide some visibility into the aggregation of software and the possible risks to training delivery from component interactions. The system manager has increased visibility allowing investments to be targeted in areas where they will achieve more impact on military training capabilities.
