    To succeed in their mission, todays military ground forces must maintain constant awareness, accurately assess possible threats, anticipate enemy actions, and preemptively address dangers by reading subtle cues within the complex battlespace. In other words, military must possess keen perceptual skills. Unfortunately, explicit perceptual training is rarely offered to most enlisted personnel. Thus, our broad research goals are to better define a continuum of perceptual skills and develop a range of instructional methodologies and technologies to support their instruction for military personnel. We began this effort by first examining the existing academic literature, seeking a readymade catalog of perceptual skills to use as an organizing framework for our research. However, existing theory lacks sufficient precision for our applied training task. Consequently, because a suitable roadmap of perceptual skills could not be found, we sought to develop one. In this paper we discuss the creation process of our perceptual cognitive skills taxonomy. First, we briefly describe 15 taxonomies related to perception that provide insight into perceptual training but fail to comprehensively define the range of perceptual skills. Second, we discuss three best practices for the development of a comprehensive skill taxonomy, which we uncovered through our development process. Finally, we close the paper by briefly describing our proposed taxonomy of perceptual cognitive skills.
